You were admitted to the hospital because you were having trouble breathing related to fluid building up in the lungs. To help you breath, you required a breathing tube. You received medication to promote urination of the extra fluid from the body. With the extra fluid removed, you were able to come off of the breathing tube and we were able to send you back to ___. Please make the following changes to your medications: 1. CHANGE lasix to 80mg IV twice daily 2. STOP Heparin IV infusion 3. STOP meropenem 4. STOP sodium bicarb IV infusion 5. STAOP vancomycin 6. STOP albuterol/ipratropium combination inhaler 7. START albuterol meter-dosed inhaler two puffs inhaled by mouth every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath/wheeze 8. START metoprolol tartrate 25mg by mouth twice daily. 9. START atorvastatin 80mg by mouth once daily 10. START citalopram 40mg by mouth daily 11. START trazodone 100mg by mouth once nightly, and an extra 50mg by mouth once nightly as needed for insomnia. 12. START sevaelamer carbonate 800mg by mouth three times daily with meals 13.

","___ M h/o chronic systolic CHF (EF 40-45%), COPD, basal carcinoma nevus syndrome, recent hospitalization for malignant otitis externa presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation in the ED. Treated with aggressive diuresis and improved. Extubated successfully and being discharged back to ___ for continued management of multiple medical problems. #Respiratory failure: VBG on arrival to ED was 7.___/31. Per report, patient was awake and expressed desire for intubation in the ED; he was intubated in the ED without complication. Given marked peripheral edema on exam, the patient's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to acute CHF exacerbation and volume overload. There was also question of superimposed pneumonia, but patient did not have leukocytosis or fever (patient also on broad antibiotics - vancomycin and meropenem - prior to presentation for ear infection), so thought to be less important clinically. Patient was started on a lasix drip 20 mg/hr, and responded well to it with good urine output. With improvement in respiratory status, patient was extubated successfully. #Chronic systolic CHF/CAD: Thought to be secondary to past ischmic event based on segmental hypokinesis seen on TTE several weeks prior to admission. Metoprolol was held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation. PO metoprolol was restarted at home dosing. Patient is being discharged on IV lasix 80 mg BID. ___ was not started given the report of increased creatinine in the past with ___, though it would be an appropriate medication for his CHF management. If his creatinine continues to improve with further diuresis, addition of ___ or spironolactone may be considered. #Hypoglycemia: Blood glucose was in ___ on admission; no diabetes medications on admission. Patient was maintained on D10 until he was extubated and was no longer NPO. Hypoglycemia resolved when patient was taking PO. #Goals of care: Patient was DNR/DNI on last admission but expressed desire for intubation in ED. Patient initially expressed a desire to be full code, but with continued discussion, stated that he would like to be DNR, but ok to intubate. Continued discussion with both the patient and his family would be useful. #Malignant otitis externa: Patient was hospitalized 2 weeks ago for otitis externa; he was still on IV vancomycin, IV meropenem, and tobramycin/dexamethasone ear drops on admission. Although the original 2-week abx courses ended on ___, IV meropenem and tobramycin were continued. Vancomycin was held for several days given high vancomycin troughs. Prior to discharge, his vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued and his outpatient ID team was notified of the decision. He will follow up with his ID team and ENT as an outpatient for further management. #Stage IV CKD: Cr was stable at 2.3-2.5 (prior baseline according to last discharge summary was 2.7 in ___. Home regimen of nephrocaps, sevelamer, and vitamin D were restarted after extubation. #COPD: Patient's home regimen of fluticasone-salmeterol and tiotropoium was continued. PRN ipratropium was discontinued given that the patient was also on tiotropium. Given the exam without a lot of wheeze, it was thought that his COPD was not the main contributor to his respiratory distress. #GERD: PO omeprazole held while on IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis; restarted after extubation. #BPH: PO tamsulosin restarted after extubation. #Glaucoma: home latanoprost, dorzolamide, and artificial tears were continued. #DM: reportedly diet-controlled and patient had period of hypoglycemia while he was NPO and intubated. Blood sugars ok while taking PO. #Anemia: PO iron and ascorbic acid were restarted after extubation. #Hyperlipidemia: PO atorvastatin was restarted after extubation. #HTN: Metoprolol was held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation, but restarted after he was extubated and his symptoms improved. #Depression: PO citalopram and trazodone were restarted after extubation. TRANSITIONS IN CARE: 1. CODE STATUS: DNR, ok to re-intubate 2. CONTACTS: Patient's son (___) ___ 3. MEDICATION CHANGES: 1. CHANGE lasix to 80mg IV twice daily 2. STOP Heparin IV infusion 3. STOP meropenem 4. STOP sodium bicarb IV infusion 5. STOP vancomycin 6. STOP albuterol/ipratropium combination inhaler 7. START albuterol meter-dosed inhaler two puffs inhaled by mouth every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath/wheeze 8. START metoprolol tartrate 25mg by mouth twice daily. 9.

Mediastinal contour is stable. Bony structures are intact. IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly with mild hilar congestion. Tiny pleural effusions. ECHO ___: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation (inferior free wall is frankly akinetic) (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to global contractile dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, dyssynchrony. A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transthoracic study with transpulmonic microbubble contrast is recommended to better define the endocardium of the left ventricle.

This was due to a condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up into your lungs. The cause of this is still unclear. Many tests were sent but did not show a clear cause. You were given a diuretic medication through the IV to help get the fluid out. You were also found to have a blood clot in your heart. This was treated with blood thinners. You will continue injections of enoxaparin (Lovenox) until your warfarin (Coumadin) levels come up. When you were ready to leave the hospital, you were set up with a device to monitor your heart. You will follow up closely with our heart failure specialists to continue to manage this issue. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below) - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Weigh yourself every morning, seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night.

Empiric Abx with vanc/cefepime were started but DCed once culures returned negative. . # Blood pressure Patient was on continuous telemetry monitoring, with no acute events. Lisinopril was initially continued on admission but then held because of soft pressures after intubation; he was on low dose phenylephrine while on propofol, but the pressor was weaned off after 3 days. He was resumed on his lisinopril on discharge. . # Endocrine Home metformin was held due to need for multiple medication changes and tests that could affect renal function. The patient was treated with insulin SS. Metformin was reinstated and tolerated well prior to discharge. . # TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # - Increased prednisone to 60mg daily - Increased azathioprine to 200mg daily - Stopped Mestinon ",3896,620,"A 45-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer presents with worsening back pain, neurological symptoms such as shortness of breath, dysarthria, and dysphagia, which are thought to be related to her myasthenia gravis.

GI was consulted, and the case was staffed with her outpatient gastroenterologist. She had negative stool cultures. She underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy, the findings of which were consistent with active ulcerative colitis (pathology similarly consistent with UC). CT scan showed colonic inflammation to the splenic flexure, consistent with a UC flare. Colorectal was consulted, with plan for surgery. She underwent a laparoscopic proctocolectomy with end ileostomy on ___. She tolerated the procedure well with no complications and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. Please see the operative note for technical details. Postop, her pain was initially controlled with a dilaudid PCA then she was switched to oral pain meds. Her diet was initially advanced to clears on POD#1 but he became nauseous from this was was made NPO again. She was then advanced slowly till she was tolerating a regular diet. On POD#7, she c/o urinary urgency and a UA showed large luekocytes so she was given ceftriaxone for one day then switched to 3 day course of ciprofloxacin. The days afterwards were spent encouraging her to increase her PO intake, working with a dietician and continuing TPN. By POD#11, she was ambulating with assistance, tolerating regular diet and her pain was controlled with oral pain meds so she was deemd fit for discharge to a rehab facility. # Hypokalemia: Ongoing hypokalemia associated with continued diarrhea. She was repleted twice to three times daily while being monitored on telemetry. # Weakness: Nonfocal neurologic exam throughout with negative head CT and no signs or symptoms of sepsis. Most likely due to deconditioning and ongoing diarrheal losses. Patient refused to work with Physical Therapy while on the ___ but was willing to ambulate and get OOB after surgery. Her nutrition was supplemented with Ensure and she was started on TPN postop. She was also given Megace to help stimulate her appetite; calorie counts were ordered and she was seen by a dietician to advice her on the best types of foods to consume to maximize caloric intake. # Acute on Chronic Anemia: Likely having small GI losses from her ulcerative colitis with low iron stores from poor nutrition. Because she is a Jehovah's Witness, she will not accept blood products; a signed acknowledgement of this was placed in her chart, and confirmed with her HCP/daughter. # Latent TB: Patient had been started on INH in preparation for starting Remicade; however, after biologic therapy was determined not to be an option for her, patient opted to discontinue her INH. # Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS-VASC of ___ with history of stroke putting her at high thromboembolic risk. Xarelto was stopped pre-operatively in favor of heparin gtt... Her home metoprolol was continued (except when held for low blood pressures responsive to IV fluids as above). Postop, heparin gtt was stopped and levenox was restarted. She was restarted on metoprolol to control her atrial fibrillation after surgery. She will restart Xarelto after discharge. # Glaucoma: Continued home dose eye drops. # Hypertension: Held home Norvasc given normotension (with occasional episodes of hypotension).

","Mr. ___ was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service under Dr. ___ on ___ for pain control after a splenic artery embolization done by the Interventional Radiology service. He received PO Dilaudid and standing tylenol for pain control during his hospital stay. On the morning of ___, his Hct was 19.4, a repeat Hct was 18.6. He was given 2u pRBCs. A post-transfusion Hct was 22. He spiked to 102.7 for which he was pan-cultred. CXR was negative for pneumonia. IV Zosyn was started for empiric coverage. Right groin puncture site pain was persistent. U/S of the area identified a 2.5 cm partially thrombosed right groin pseudoaneurysm, with a neck measuring 3 mm in width. Hct decreased to 19 again. IV Vitamin K was given for INR of 2.9. An abdominal CT was also done demonstrating just ascites. Post CT, creatinine increased to 3.9. He was bloused with IV fluid for low urine output. ___ then embolized the pseudoaneurysm on ___. Postop, embolization, right groin appeared ecchymotic with positive distal pulses. He had less pain in the right groin. Hct was down to 17. Two units of PRBC were transfused with post hct of 23. Postop transfusion, he had an 8 beat run of VTach that resolved. Calcium repletion was given for calcium of 7.5. Hct stabilized at ___. LFTs were notable of rise in t.bili to 3.9. ERCP was done on to interrogate the metal stent on ___. It was noted that the previously placed metal stent had migrated, a CBD anastomotic stricture was noted and a new MS was placed. He tolerated this procedure well and diet was advanced to regular the next day. A repeat U/S of the groin was done on ___lood flow at the neck of the pseudoaneurysm which may represent a small arterial branch vessel. No documented flow within the body of the pseudoaneurysm. He continued to have discomfort at this site as well as abdominal and back pain for which he was receiving po Dilaudid. He was taking a total of ___ per day of the Dilaudid. The plan was to send him home with a script for dilaudid 2mg prn every 8 hours with only 10 tabs. Of note, the anemia/hemolysis w/u was negative. He received a total of 3 units of prbc. Leukopenia was improving. Blood and urine cultures were negative to date. Creatinine increased and this was likely related to the contrast given during the angiogram.

Though initial ultrasounds of your leg did not show blood clots in the lower leg, a CT scan of your pelvis revealed a 2-cm clot in your external iliac vein. You may have a higher tendency to form clots given your history of cancer and radiation to your bladder. We started you on a blood thinning medication called Coumadin (Warfarin) which you will continue for 6 months. Your INR level is a measure of how well your blood is being thinned and your goal level is ___. You will need to have this checked frequently and your dose adjusted accordingly. Until you INR level is therapeutic, you should continue to take Lovenox injections twice daily as you have been doing in the hospital. You will have your bloodwork checked on ___. You will follow with your PCP and Dr. ___ at the dates/times below. We have made the following changes to your medications: - Take Lovenox injections (110mg) at 8am and 8pm every day until your INR is ___ - Take Coumadin 10mg daily and get your INR level measured frequently - Continue the rest of your home medications ","Pt is ___ yo M with hx of of prior silent MI, HTN, HLD, transitional cell carcinoma (s/p radiation, no surgery or chemo) who p/w LLE edema and swelling . # DVT: Given the patient's history of bladder cancer and radiation within the past year, his LLE edema was most consistent on presentation with lymphatic obstruction, either from reseeding of the lymphatic bed with tumor or direct damage from radiation. However, the patient's pain on hip flexion, tenderness in the left hip, and acute onset suggested DVT. LENIs were negative, suggesting a more proximal DVT. He was started on a heparin drip on admission. CT abd/pelvis the following day demonstrated a 2cm DVT in the left external iliac vein. The patient's heparin drip was continued, and he was started on 5mg coumadin. His INR remained subtherapeutic, and his coumadin was increased to 10mg. The patient initially refused to go home on Lovenox injections on account of his fear of needles but after several attempts at counseling, he agreed to administer his own Lovenox with the assistance of a home ___ until his INR became therapeutic. He was discharged with 110mg BID Lovenox injections, 10mg coumadin qdaily, and scheduled to follow-up with his PCP to manage his anticoagulation over the next 6 months. He should follow-up with oncology or his PCP regarding how long to continue on anticoagulation given that inciting cause of DVT was either malignancy or XRT and it is unclear whether the provoking agent can ever be considered removed. . # Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline Cr is 1.2 and was 1.3 on admission. Per the patient, he has been dehydrated the previous 2 days. His Cr remained at baseline after adequate IVF rehydration and was 1.2 upon discharge. . # Bladder CA - In-house CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence or metastatic spread of patient's previous bladder cancer. The patient was scheduled for routine surveillance CT in ___, and we have communicated with his radiation oncologist in order to cancel this study, if the in-house CT performed during this hospitalization is sufficient to rule out recurrence. . # HTN - The patient's blood pressure was well-controlled throughout his hospitalization on his home anti-hypertensives. . # Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on his home statin. . # S/p silent MI - Given the patient's history of silent MI, we have communicated with the patient's PCP regarding aspirin and ACE inhibitor therapy. He will follow-up with his PCP for further management of this condition. .

The patient is admitted with symptoms of left leg swelling, pain, and redness. Ultrasound findings of a clot in the left external iliac vein suggest deep vein thrombosis. Warfarin is started to prevent further clotting, and Lovenox injections are continued for symptom relief.

Suboptimal evaluation of the lung parenchyma due to respiratory motion artifact, there is complete collapsibility of bronchus intermedius and near-complete collapse of bilateral upper lobe bronchi. 2. 38% decrease of tracheal area at the sternal notch and 62% decrease at approximately 2 cm above the carina. Persistent severe bronchomalacia with mainstem bronchi measuring less than 3 mm with near-complete collapse on expiration. However, as noted above, respiratory motion results in incomplete analysis of inspiratory and expiratory measurements. 3. Multiple new bilateral parenchymal opacities, with more confluent within the bilateral lower lobes, are concerning for aspiration with some element of mucoid impaction. 4. Stable subsolid lesion with ground-glass opacity and cystic foci, currently measuring 18 x 10 mm, previously 16 x 13 mm. Given the degree of respiratory motion artifact, these measurements are approximation. 5. Moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysema. 6. Persistent prominence of the main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 3.1 cm. Given patient's known background moderate to severe centrilobular emphysema, this is likely a sequela of pulmonary arterial hypertension. CXR ___ IMPRESSION: Decreased small pleural effusions.

We believe your symptoms may have been secondary to a viral infection. We treated you with a medication called tamiflu for the flu. Additionally, you developed a rash on your left lower leg, which may have been an infection. We treated you with antibiotics, initially vancomycin, which was changed to cephalexin at the time of discharge. One sample of your blood from ___ grew Staph aureus, which was likely contamination from the blood draw. Regardless, it will be covered by your cephalexin. You should continue to get plenty of rest and drink fluids at home. See below for your follow-up appointments. Please see attached for an updated list of your medications. Wishing you all the best! ","___ m with hx of HTN, DM II, BPH who presented with sudden onset fevers, chills, and rigors. Infectious work up concerning for possible retrocardiac pneumonia +/- influenza. Hospital course c/b rash on L leg and positive blood culture. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Fevers: Most likely secondary to a viral process. Patient had defervesced on arrival, but had one low-grade fever on HOD #3. Initially, he was treated empirically with Tamiflu for suspected influenza infection. After his DFA returned negative for flu on HOD #4, Tamiflu was discontinued. One blood culture from HOD #3 return positive for coagulase negative staph, but as all other blood cultures from this admission were negative, and patient was hemodynamically stable, this was most likely a contaminant. Additionally, he was noted to have a patchy erythematous rash on his left lower leg on HOD #3. Thus, he was started on vancomycin empirically for coverage of cellulitis. He continued vancomycin ___ at discharge; at that time, he was transitioned to cephalexin to complete a 7-day course of antibiotics for cellulitis. Although rash appeared atypical for cellulitis, it seemed to improve with antibiotics. ACE wraps were applied to legs, and legs were elevated, as patient reported similar afflication with venous stasis in the past. # Bacteremia: One blood culture from ___ grew coagulase-negative staph. Although this was likely just a contaminant (blood cultures from ___ and ___ without growth, it was covered by empiric antibiotics, as above. Patient will finish 7-day course of cephalexin as an outpatient. # LLE Rash / cellulitis: Unilateral, with patchy erythema that appeared atypical for cellulitis. LLE ultrasound was negative for DVT. In the setting of fevers, empiric vancomycin was started on ___ for coverage, and rash appeared to improve. Patient to complete 7-day course with cephalexin after discharge. ACE wraps were applied to legs, and legs were elevated, as patient reported similar afflication with venous stasis in the past. He was instructed to use compression stockings at home. His ultrasound did show an enlarged lymph node on the left side, c/w an underlying infectious/inflammatory process. CHRONIC ISSUES: #HTN: Stable. Continued on home regimen. #BPH: Patient denied any recent urinary retention or hesitancy. Prostate exam normal. He continued his home finesteride and doxazosin. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Follow up finalized blood cultures from ___ and ___. # Consider repeat imaging if left inguinal LAD persists # Full code: confirmed ",2634,576,"A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and type 2 diabetes presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month.

Sincerely, Your ___ Team ","SUMMARY STATEMENT ================= Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease s/p left AKA and R bypass c/b graft and popliteal artery stenosis s/p multiple angioplasties, DM, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, presenting with polymicrobial R heel infection s/p debridement x2, with wound vac and on IV vanc/cefepime/flagyl for 6 week course per ID recommendation. ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED: ===================== #Polymicrobial R heel osteomyelitis, R heel ulcer infection History of T2DM and severe PVD s/p R bypass with multiple angioplasties, chronic right heel ulcer, presented with heel ulcer drainage, pain and erythema. She underwent OR I&D/debridement x2 (___) with Podiatry. Operative debridement yielded deep purulence down to the calcaneus. Due to the chronicity of the ulcer and the proximity of the purulence so close to calcaneus, decision made to treat for osteomyelitis. Vascular surgery was consulted and said there was no need for intervention. Wound cultures grew two morphologies of e. coli (which had no clear PO options for treatment based on sensitivities, but were susceptible to CTX), b frag, and coag neg staph sensitive to clinda/vanc. No pseudomonas. Blood cx no growth. Infectious Disease team was consulted and recommended cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole given possibility of pseudonomonas ___ diabetic patient, even if not grown on culture. Antibiotic course planned for 6 weeks from last instrumentation ___, therefore finishing ___. She was cleared by Physical Therapy for home. She will follow-up with podiatry, vascular, and ID. Her daughter ___ was trained on taking care of the wound vac at home (per Podiatry, anticipate several weeks) and home antibiotic administration. She will have weekly labs checked. #Revision of diagnosis: No secondary adrenal insufficiency During last hospitalization, as part of workup for hyponatremia, she was thought to have secondary adrenal insufficiency. The etiology was not elucidated, however, she was started on hydrocortisone 10 mg QAM. Given active infection and surgery this admission, she received stress dose steroids with a taper. Following this, the ID team noted a positive quantiferon gold that had resulted from the last admission. Endocrine was reconsulted to further investigate the AI diagnosis as patient might require latent TB treatment if planning for chronic steroids. On repeat ___ stim testing, pt had appropriate and robust response, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely. MRI adrenal protocol was within normal limits. ACTH levels were normal. Patient no longer though to have AI. #Hyponatremia #?SIADH Worked up extensively last admission and felt to be due to secondary adrenal insufficiency with possible SIADH. This admission, adrenal insufficiency workup was again pursued and it was determined patient does not have this. Steroids were discontinued, pressures were maintained, and there was no ill effect. Several days later, patient's sodium downtrended. Urine studies consistent with SIADH so patient placed on fluid restriction of 1.5 liters. Her sodium levels fluctuated but ultimately stable and near normal limits. #Diabetes Mellitus, type 2 On admission, held home metformin 500mg PO BID, continued home lantus 10 units QHS, and provided insulin sliding scale. Elevated blood sugars ___ the setting of stress-dose steroids, were covered with NPH, subsequently discontinued. On ___, metformin 500mg BID was restarted as patient awaiting placement. #Hypertension Patient's blood pressures were elevated and lisinopril was uptitrated from 10mg to 40mg with good results. # Anemia Underlying Iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Hgb 9.1 on admission. Received 2U pRBC following surgeries. Patient was given IV ferrous gluconate for 4 days. Stable rest of admission. CHRONIC ISSUES ADDRESSED: ======================= #Type 4 RTA Diagnosed last admission and thought ___ diabetes. Continued on sodium bicarbonate. #Latent TB Quant gold+. No pulmonary sx, CXR unconcerning, and adrenals within normal limits on CT. Pt is at moderate risk for reactivation given insulin-dependent diabetes, though does not have adrenal insufficiency and so will not receive further steroids. ___ consultation with ID, treatment of latent TB was deferred. # Peripheral vascular disease History of severe peripheral vascular disease s/p left AKA and R bypass c/b graft and popliteal artery stenosis s/p multiple angioplasties. Chronic R non-healing ulcer ___ setting of T2DM and severe PVD. This admission she had noninvasive RLE arterial study which showed severe obstructive arterial disease. Vascular surgery was consulted and said that no intervention was indicated. Continued home ASA, atorvastatin, clopidogrel; stopped home cilostazol --for claudication, patient not ambulatory, and wanted to reduce pill burden and risk of side effects.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

After surgery, he developed a persistent, large heterogenous mass lesion in the right temporal lobe, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic, and solid components. The mass is located near the right temporal horn and shows mild residual entrapment of the right lateral ventricle. The pathology pending indicates that the mass is likely a neurogenic tumor. The patient's condition is stable, and he is expected to recover fully with appropriate treatment and follow-up care.","You are a helpful clinical NLP evaluation assistant.

Please call your regular doctor or come to the ED if you experience agitation, change in your mental status, confusion, fever, chills, or any other symptoms that concern you. ","In brief this is a ___ year old male with dementia and CKD admitted for aggressive behavior. . #. Agressive behavior. Medical workup for delerium has been negative. Patient has been afebrile with an normal WBC and negative UA. Head CT showed no acute changes. Utox and Stox were negative. Renal function was at baseline. Most likely the agitation is secondary to patient's Alzheimer's dementia and worsening over two weeks prior to admission may be due to enviroment/medication changes. Psych was consulted and they recommended d/c all psychotropic drugs except olanzepine. The patient did very well with olanzapine (2.5 mg in am, 2.5 mg at 3 pm and 7.5 mg HS; also prn SL olanzepine q 4 hrs prn). For insomnia pt did well with an additional 2.5mh prn qhs dose in addition to his standing 7.5mg qhs dose. . Over the course of the 2 weeks prior to discharge, pt has made dramatic behavioral improvements. He has taken all of his standing olanzapine and has required very few prn doses (more for increased confusion than agitation) since ___. He continues to wander in the hallway, but does not wander into rooms other than his own. He continues to require a 1:1 sitter, but this is only because he is very disoriented and may otherwise wander off the floor since this unit is not locked. He has not displayed aggressive behavior towards staff these past 2 weeks. . It is important to note, that his behavioral decompensation prior leading to this admission was most likely the consequence of too frequent medication changes. We strongly advise adherence to the previously described olanzapine regimen as much as possible. His family is comfortable with the sedation caused by this regimen and understands that it is the trade-off necessary for better behavioral control. . #. Chronic constipation. Bowel regimen included ___ standing and bisacodyl prn. Fleet enemas may be used as needed. Pt perseverates on his bowel movements. He always complains of constipation, even after having adequate bowel movements. . #. CKD. Renal function was at baseline and remained throughout hospitalization. Slight intermittent elevations in creatinine responded well to encouraging increased po intake.

**Clinical NLP Evaluation Assistant Response:**

**Analysis:**

This patient presents with a concerning red blood episode, likely related to a possible gastrointestinal issue. The initial presentation indicates urgency and requires further investigation. The patient reports a history of colon cancer and breast cancer, which raises the concern for potential malignancy. The acute bleeding suggests possible vascular compromise or other underlying condition.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Further Investigation:** The priority is to determine the cause of the bleeding. Consider a colon",False,False,False,0

You were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the following instructions. Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the appointment listed below. ACTIVITY: o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and feel you could respond in an emergency. o You may climb stairs. o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. o Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap. o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you can resume tub baths or swimming. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: o You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during surgery. o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You might feel somewhat depressed. o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem unappealing. o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon. YOUR INCISION: o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay). o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is normal. o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision. o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area. o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told otherwise. o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call your surgeon. o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may resume tub baths or swimming. YOUR BOWELS: o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. PAIN MANAGEMENT: o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more medicine at one time than prescribed. o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your pain gets too severe. o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your surgeon has said its okay. o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of pain medicine. o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises. If you experience any of the following, please contact your surgeon: - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours - pain that is getting worse over time - pain accompanied by fever of more than 101 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain MEDICATIONS: Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently. If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to take, please call your surgeon. ","The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on ___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain. Admission abdominal ultra-sound revealed cholelithiasis. The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating sips, on IV fluids, and IV analgesia for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable. . Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay. . At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient was discharged home without services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

","Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy. He was initially admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ however was transferred to ___ on ___. Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if <25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge.

At that time, she describes ""stretching"" by fully extending her neck. In the midst of the maneuver, she states she developed an acute sense of ""severe sea-sickness,"" requiring her to hold on to the nearby oven for support. She says she had diarrhea within about three minutes of the symptom, and had to crawl to the bathroom because attempts to walk resulted in the persistent feeling that she would fall to the right. Other associated symptoms included nausea, although the pt denies vomiting. Following the episode of diarrhea, she assumed a supine position. She says that lying still ""with no movement"" seemed to decrease the intensity of the feeling of sea-sickness. She denies similar episodes in the past. The sx prompted her to call her PCP, who recommended she go to the ED for evaluation. The pt initially presented to the ___ by ambulance. The pt recalls the persistence of sea-sickness and nausea for about ___ hours until she was given an IV (which she thinks provided NS). This examiner could not elucidate from the available notes what treatment was given. The pt recalls a transient (~30 minute episode) of ""blurred vision"" while at ___ which she said spontaneously resolved. Notes suggest that the physicians at the OSH noted ""faint fatiguing nystagmus to the right"" and inferior visual field cuts.

You had a benign abdominal exam without fevers, chills or recent sick contacts making bowel obstruction or infection unlikely. The symptoms started after transitioning to oral antibiotics while in the hospital last week and this was felt to be the most likely cause of your symptoms. After speaking with your surgeon, Dr. ___, the decision was made to stop your flagyl (a common cause of stomach upset) and fluconazole. Your symptoms improved significantly with antiemetics (medications for nausea) and transition to ciprofloxacin only. At discharge, you were tolerating a normal, diabetic diet and able to take in adequate calories. Because of this, you were not felt to need nutritional support with tube feeds or TPN at this time. It is very important that you continue to consume enough calories to maintain your weight and ultimately start to gain back the weight you have lost over the last several months. While you were here, you noted that your pain post-surgery was significantly improved and your oxycontin was decreased from 40mg BID to 30mg BID. We also have provided you with stool softeners to prevent constipation. Please continue to take ciprofloxacin twice daily until you follow-up with Dr. ___ at ___ for drain removal on ___. It was a pleasure taking care of you! Your ___ Care Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman who is 4 weeks s/p total pancreatectomy (complete pancreatectomy, total splenectomy, partial duodenectomy, partial gastrectomy, islet cell re-implantation) complicated by bacteremia (enterobacter) and two abdominal abscesses 1.5 weeks ago who presented with several days of nausea/vomiting on oral antibiotics. # Nausea/vomiting: The patient was evaluated for common etiologies of nausea/vomiting. Obstruction was not likely given his relatively benign exam and history recent bowel movements. Recurrence of his intrabdominal infection was less unlikely given no recent fevers or changes in output from his drains and improved WBC count. Gastroenteritis also unlikely, given no recent sick contacts and improvement with IV abx. His symptoms are most likely related to recent changes to PO medication list, notably a switch from IV to PO ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and fluconazole. A review of OSH records and discussion with the attending surgeon (Dr. ___ at ___ clarified antibiotic requirement. The patient had documented ciprofloxacin-sensitive E. aerogenes (GNR) bacteremia secondary to a PICC line, however patient has been on fluconazole and flagyl for 2 weeks without a clear target. The outpatient surgery team and inpatient medicine team agreed the fluconazole and flagyl could be discontinued given lack of culture data or clinical suspicion supporting their use beyond two weeks. The patient was switched to PO ciprofloxacin only, and allowed to progress his diet as tolerated. The patient did not feel nausea with the PO ciprofloxacin and progressed from a clear liquid, full liquid, to a regular diet by the time of discharge. He also gained weight during his recovery. PICC line placement was discussed with the patient, but given his tolerating PO ciprofloxacin, his progressing diet, and his gaining weight, this was not pursued, especially given his recent PICC-line associated bacteremia and splenectomy making TPN high risk. The patient was given a bowel regimen and was stooling comfortably before discharge. # Failure to thrive: The patient reports poor PO intake since before his pancreatectomy. Given improving PO intake and recent bacteremia, it was decided not to start TPN during this admission. The patient was seen by nutrition and caloric intake and his daily weights were monitored. By the time of discharge, his weight was stable on regular diabetic diet. # Total pancreatectomy: The patient's two JP drains were left in place. The patient was continued on his prescribed insulin replacement therapy. The patient was given his oxycontin dose for pain. The patient's pain was well-controlled and by the end of his hospitalization, his oxycontin dose was decreased to 30mg BID. The patient was also continued on his PPI. # Thrombocytosis: The patient was admitted with platelets over 1000. This is most likely reactive in the setting of recent surgery and due to splenectomy. His PLT count was downtrending through his stay and he was continued on his ASA 325mg. # Anxiety: The patient was treated with his home dosing of Escitalopram.

Please return to the emergency department or notify your physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns. 2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this admission and any new medications and refills. 3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed. 4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent this side effect. Call your surgeons office 3 days before you are out of medication so that it can be refilled. These medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be picked up in the clinic or mailed to your house.

Do not place ice directly on the skin. You may wrap the knee with an ace bandage for added compression. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as Celebrex, ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc) until cleared by your physician. 8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Aspirin 325 mg twice daily for four (4) weeks to help prevent deep vein thrombosis (blood clots). Continue Pantoprazole daily while on Aspirin to prevent GI upset (x 4 weeks). If you were taking Aspirin prior to your surgery, take it at 325 mg twice daily until the end of the 4 weeks, then you can go back to your normal dosing. 9. WOUND CARE: Do not allow the incision to dry out completely. Moisturize the wound with a petroleum jelly or a similar emollient regularly. Ensure that the incision heals as expected, and do not put any additional pressure on the incision. Avoid placing anything, such as a bandage, directly on the incision until it is fully healed. 07: 50 AM

Less likely etiologies included: legionella (esp considering hyponatremia although urine ag negative)), TB (no hx of exposure, prior PPD negative). She was also treated for pulm edema suggested by CXR (however, echo was not consistent with CHF and EKG not suggestive of MI/ACS as cause of CHF). Her leukocytosis resolved (16.3-->10.8) on Levofloxacin. Pt also rec'd Lasix w good urine output. Crackles improved on hospital day 3. - Levofloxacin to 750mg PO per day for CAP (___) Inactive Issues: #Macrocytosis Likely ___ MTX therapy. B12 and folate wnl. # RA: Followed by rheumatologist.
