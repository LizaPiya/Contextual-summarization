Discharge weight: 94 kg <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr. ___, It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You were admitted to the hospital because you were having trouble breathing related to fluid building up in the lungs. To help you breath, you required a breathing tube. You received medication to promote urination of the extra fluid from the body. With the extra fluid removed, you were able to come off of the breathing tube and we were able to send you back to ___. Please make the following changes to your medications: 1. CHANGE lasix to 80mg IV twice daily 2. STOP Heparin IV infusion 3. STOP meropenem 4. STOP sodium bicarb IV infusion 5. STAOP vancomycin 6. STOP albuterol/ipratropium combination inhaler 7. START albuterol meter-dosed inhaler two puffs inhaled by mouth every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath/wheeze 8. START metoprolol tartrate 25mg by mouth twice daily. 9. START atorvastatin 80mg by mouth once daily 10. START citalopram 40mg by mouth daily 11. START trazodone 100mg by mouth once nightly, and an extra 50mg by mouth once nightly as needed for insomnia. 12. START sevaelamer carbonate 800mg by mouth three times daily with meals 13. START nephrocaps. I cap by mouth daily 14. START docusate sodium 100mg by mouth twice daily 15. START ascorbic acid ___ by mouth twice daily 16. START ferrous sulfate 325mg by mouth daily 17. START cholecalciferol 400units by mouth daily 18. START heparin 5000units by subcutaneous injection three times daily Please continue all other medications as previously prescribed. Please keep all follow-up appointments. ","The patient presents with respiratory distress characterized by difficulty breathing, cough, and tachypnea, which have been worsening over the past 24 hours. The patient's oxygen saturation has remained low despite receiving supplemental oxygen. Vital signs indicate hypotension and decreased cardiac output, and there is evidence of respiratory compromise indicated by increased work of breathing and elevated respiratory rate. Imaging studies reveal bilateral facial and scalp tumors (basal cell carcinomas), and systemic findings consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including right-sided heart failure. The patient's mental status is stable, and the patient remains alert and oriented. 

Key points:

- **Respiratory Distress**: Difficulty breathing with cough, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing.
- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension and decreased cardiac output, indicating possible acute decompensation.
- **Respiratory Failure**: Elevated respiratory rate and PaCO2 level suggest severe respiratory acidosis.
- **Systemic Complications**: Bilateral basal cell carcinomas and systemic findings consistent with chronic diseases.
- **Mental Status**: Stable but confused, requiring close monitoring.
- **General Considerations**: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to severe respiratory distress and potential complications. Initial treatments included albuterol and antibiotics, but further intervention may be necessary based on lab results and clinical judgment.

**Treatment and Monitoring**

1. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation levels.
2. Continuous oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygen","___ M h/o chronic systolic CHF (EF 40-45%), COPD, basal carcinoma nevus syndrome, recent hospitalization for malignant otitis externa presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation in the ED. Treated with aggressive diuresis and improved. Extubated successfully and being discharged back to ___ for continued management of multiple medical problems. #Respiratory failure: VBG on arrival to ED was 7.___/31. Per report, patient was awake and expressed desire for intubation in the ED; he was intubated in the ED without complication. Given marked peripheral edema on exam, the patient's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to acute CHF exacerbation and volume overload. There was also question of superimposed pneumonia, but patient did not have leukocytosis or fever (patient also on broad antibiotics - vancomycin and meropenem - prior to presentation for ear infection), so thought to be less important clinically. Patient was started on a lasix drip 20 mg/hr, and responded well to it with good urine output. With improvement in respiratory status, patient was extubated successfully. #Chronic systolic CHF/CAD: Thought to be secondary to past ischmic event based on segmental hypokinesis seen on TTE several weeks prior to admission. Metoprolol was held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation. PO metoprolol was restarted at home dosing. Patient is being discharged on IV lasix 80 mg BID. ___ was not started given the report of increased creatinine in the past with ___, though it would be an appropriate medication for his CHF management. If his creatinine continues to improve with further diuresis, addition of ___ or spironolactone may be considered. #Hypoglycemia: Blood glucose was in ___ on admission; no diabetes medications on admission. Patient was maintained on D10 until he was extubated and was no longer NPO. Hypoglycemia resolved when patient was taking PO. #Goals of care: Patient was DNR/DNI on last admission but expressed desire for intubation in ED. Patient initially expressed a desire to be full code, but with continued discussion, stated that he would like to be DNR, but ok to intubate. Continued discussion with both the patient and his family would be useful. #Malignant otitis externa: Patient was hospitalized 2 weeks ago for otitis externa; he was still on IV vancomycin, IV meropenem, and tobramycin/dexamethasone ear drops on admission. Although the original 2-week abx courses ended on ___, IV meropenem and tobramycin were continued. Vancomycin was held for several days given high vancomycin troughs. Prior to discharge, his vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued and his outpatient ID team was notified of the decision. He will follow up with his ID team and ENT as an outpatient for further management. #Stage IV CKD: Cr was stable at 2.3-2.5 (prior baseline according to last discharge summary was 2.7 in ___. Home regimen of nephrocaps, sevelamer, and vitamin D were restarted after extubation. #COPD: Patient's home regimen of fluticasone-salmeterol and tiotropoium was continued. PRN ipratropium was discontinued given that the patient was also on tiotropium. Given the exam without a lot of wheeze, it was thought that his COPD was not the main contributor to his respiratory distress. #GERD: PO omeprazole held while on IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis; restarted after extubation. #BPH: PO tamsulosin restarted after extubation. #Glaucoma: home latanoprost, dorzolamide, and artificial tears were continued. #DM: reportedly diet-controlled and patient had period of hypoglycemia while he was NPO and intubated. Blood sugars ok while taking PO. #Anemia: PO iron and ascorbic acid were restarted after extubation. #Hyperlipidemia: PO atorvastatin was restarted after extubation. #HTN: Metoprolol was held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation, but restarted after he was extubated and his symptoms improved. #Depression: PO citalopram and trazodone were restarted after extubation. TRANSITIONS IN CARE: 1. CODE STATUS: DNR, ok to re-intubate 2. CONTACTS: Patient's son (___) ___ 3. MEDICATION CHANGES: 1. CHANGE lasix to 80mg IV twice daily 2. STOP Heparin IV infusion 3. STOP meropenem 4. STOP sodium bicarb IV infusion 5. STOP vancomycin 6. STOP albuterol/ipratropium combination inhaler 7. START albuterol meter-dosed inhaler two puffs inhaled by mouth every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath/wheeze 8. START metoprolol tartrate 25mg by mouth twice daily. 9. START atorvastatin 80mg by mouth once daily 10. START citalopram 40mg by mouth daily 11. START trazodone 100mg by mouth once nightly, and an extra 50mg by mouth once nightly as needed for insomnia. 12. START sevaelamer carbonate 800mg by mouth three times daily with meals 13. START nephrocaps. I cap by mouth daily 14. START docusate sodium 100mg by mouth twice daily 15. START ascorbic acid ___ by mouth twice daily 16. START ferrous sulfate 325mg by mouth daily 17.

The MRI findings revealed a small inferior ventricular tumor with subtle enhancement, which was confirmed post-operatively. Post-operative MRI imaging showed the presence of a metallic object within the cisterna magna, suggesting possible bleeding or injury. Despite treatment with dexamethasone and antibiotics, there were persistent headaches and no improvement in symptoms. The patient's condition worsened over time, leading to further tests, including more detailed imaging studies such as CT scans. These have shown no evidence of the tumor but some minor changes in cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. 

**Discharge Information:**
- Discharge Diagnosis: Biopsy results pending.
- Discharge Condition: Normal mental status and neurological function.

It may be that you had some fluid overload which was contributing to your breathing problems. It is important that you do not drink more than one and a half liter of fluid per day and avoid sugary drinks such as gatorade as well as avoid salty foods. You should take torsemide 60mg every day. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. ","The patient is an obese female presenting to the emergency department with recurrent nocturnal awakenings characterized by shortness of breath attributed to apnea during sleep. The patient reported intermittent exercise-induced apneas, which she attributes to ""short of breath,"" but her CPAP fails to detect an apnea alarm. A recent exacerbation of her obstructive sleep apnea is noted, with worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, and abdominal pain. She has increased fluid retention and worsening swelling around the pannus. Her physical examination reveals significant clubbing, orthopnea, and tracheoesophageal fistulae, suggestive of advanced restrictive lung disease with possible chronic hypercapnia and hypoxemia. The results from lab tests including alkphos and angap support these findings. The patient is advised to continue wearing her CPAP mask 24/7. 

### **Key Findings:**

* Recurrent nocturnal awakenings due to apnea
* Shortness of breath attributed to apnea
* Obesity and respiratory problems
* Advanced restrictive lung disease
* Possible chronic hypercapnia and hypoxemia
* Current treatments: discontinuation of CPAP and consideration of major surgery 
* Current clinical status: stable condition despite ongoing apneic events and worsening symptoms","___ w/dCHF, severe pulmonary HTN, interstital lung disease, OSA, who presented to the ED for evaluation of 2 reported episodes concerning for apnea and admitted for EKG changes, likely volume overloaded in the setting of dietary indiscretion. # SOB: Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Last Echo consistent with mild LVH and preserved EF. Now with concern for volume overload in setting of increased fluid intake and edema. Her EKG changes (deepening TWI in the precordial leads) were likely due to slight volume overload. She is persistently hypoxic on ambulation to high ___ without oxygen (which she's supposed to be on for pulm HTN), refuses to use her home O2 unless she's < 80%. She also has lightheadedness and vertigo likely related to hypoxia. We diuresed her and put her back on the torsemide 60mg daily she was supposed to be on, instead of the alternating 40mg and 60mg she was using at home. We got just over a liter off. # CORONARIES:Low Concern for ACS given nonspecific EKG changes and history, but did ___ in setting of increasing volume overload and EKG findings. Patient reports confidently she is at her usual baseline CP since ___. Troponin has been flat, and MB trending down. Repeat EKG's without concern for acute ischemia. Received ASA 325mg x1. # Chronic Abdominal pain: Intermittent RUQ pain currently resolved and no evidence of abdominal tenderness on exam. LFT's WNL except AST of 56 in context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. -Pain control prn # GERD- Continued home omeprazole # T2DM - SSI # Epilepsy - Continued home meds #Transitional Issues: SOB - will follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___.

You were treated with nebulizers, steroids and antibiotics, with improvement in your symptoms. Additionally, you had a new complaint of difficulty swallowing and were evaluated by the speech therapists; you underwent a video swallow which showed no evidence of aspiration. . We made the following changes to your home medications: - Continue prednisone 40 mg daily for four days, then decrease to 20 mg daily for 5 days, then 10 mg daily for five days - Start tessalon perles as needed for cough - Continue to use albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every four hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - Please modify your diet as follows: You can drink thin liquids as long as you take one sip at a time. Also, you should have only moist, soft solid foods and medications should be taken whole mixed with pureed foods. Please continue to take all other medications as prescribed. We did not make further changes to your outpatient medications. ","The patient presents with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and cough. The shortness of breath is described as worsening over time, with symptoms becoming more pronounced at night. The patient's respiratory system is examined to be diffusely rhonchorous and worse at bases, indicating upper airway obstruction. Laboratory results show an elevated leukocyte count with neutrophils at 86.3%, lymphocytes at 7.7%, monocytes at 3.5, eosinophils at 2.3, basophils at 0.1, lactate dehydrogenase at 2.0, calcium at 9.2, phosphorus at 2.8, magnesium at 1.6, potassium at 3.1, chloride at 105 mmol/L, troponin T at less than 0.01 ng/mL, creatinine kinase at 392 IU/L, beta-2 microglobulin at 3 ng/mL, high levels of alkaline phosphatase, and very low albumin. The electrocardiogram shows ST segment depression.

## Step 1: Identify key clinical features
- Severe shortness of breath and cough
- Diffusely rhonchorrous lungs on auscultation, worse at bases
- Elevated leukocyte count with neutrophils at 86.3%
- High lactate dehydrogenase level at 2.0
- Mild cardiac involvement (beta-2","___ yo F with Asthma, HTN, OSA and GERD who presents with SOB, cough and fever consistent with asthma exacerbation and CAP. . # Asthma exacerbation: Patient known asthma, multiple hospitalization for exacerbations, but no intubations. Most likely cause of exacerbation was felt to be community acquired pneumonia. Influenza was neg by DFA. She was treated with a 7 day course of levofloxacin ending on the day of discharge, and prednisone 60 mg orally for five days, followed by a decrease to 40 mg daily. She was instructed to complete a slow prednisone taper over the next several weeks. Additionally, she was treated with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers every four hours, as well as benzonatate and guafenesin for symptomatic relief. At discharge her cough and shortness of breath were significantly improved, but still decreased from baseline. She was able to ambulate with some mild dyspnea, but no decrease in oxygen saturation. . . # GERD: Pt provided a history of significant reflux symptoms, on PPI at home. Last EGD in ___ was normal. She also provided history of more recent dysphagia particularly with solid foods and pills. She underwent a video swallow evaluation, which showed no evidence of aspiration, but some slight penetration with thin liquids. Consequently, she was advised to take thin liquids slowly (one sip at a time), soft solids and pills whole with puree. Differential for her dysphagia includes esophageal stricture, web, or malignancy. She was proved with an appointment to follow-up in GI clinic three days after discharge for possible EGD to evaluate her dysphagia. She was also continued on omeprazole during this admission. . . # ARF: Creatinine was found to be elevated from baseline several days into admission. This resolved with gentle IV fluids, and was felt to be prerenal in etiology, likely secondary to decreased PO intake during period of dyspnea with asthma exacerbation. . # Hypertension: Continued on home regimen of valasartan and verapamil. . # Anemia: Stable normocytic anemia, which appeared to be at patient's baseline of ___. . # OSA: Uses CPAP at home, which was continued during this admission. . # Hypothyroidism: Continued on home dose levothyroxane.

The patient's medical history indicates that they are at high risk due to smoking. 

### **Medically Relevant Findings:**

* Fever, chills, and general malaise suggest an infectious process.
* Elevated leukocyte count and liver enzyme elevation indicate potential bacterial infection.
* Mild pericardial effusion suggests heart involvement.
* Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting may be indicative of a gastrointestinal infection.
* Low blood pressure and tachycardia can result from dehydration or sepsis.
* Splenomegaly is likely due to infection.
* A low neutrophil count could indicate infection.

Okay, let’s analyze this case. Here's my assessment based solely on the provided text:

**Overall Impression:** This is a complex presentation involving fever, malaise, potential perianal inflammation, and an underlying history of thyroid dysfunction. The patient presents with significant symptoms suggestive of a serious condition requiring prompt investigation.  The rapid onset of worsening symptoms following treatment suggests a possible complication or progression of the illness.

You have recuperated well and you are now ready to head home. Please follow this instructions in order to continue your recovery * Your injury caused 1 rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain. Please use your IS machine every 10 minutes in order to continue improving your breathing. * You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician. * Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs. * You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing. * Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain. * Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. * Do NOT smoke * If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves. * Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs (crepitus). ","The patient presents with symptoms of trauma following a fall from a height of 15 feet onto a wooden object (likely a door frame), resulting in multiple injuries including fractures of the left posterior eleventh rib, left transverse process fractures from L1 to L4, and nondisplaced fractures of the right inferior and superior pubic rami. Despite initial findings indicating some hemodynamic instability, laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, normal coagulation studies, and minimal elevation in liver enzymes, suggesting no acute infection. Imaging studies confirm extensive lung consolidation and fluid in the lungs with patchy consolidative and ground-glass opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia. 

The patient also shows signs of significant pain due to musculoskeletal injury, with episodes of pain exacerbated by movement, particularly affecting the mid to low back. Additionally, there is mild discomfort in the right hip. There are no signs of bowel obstruction or respiratory distress in the abdominal examination. 

The diagnosis appears to involve multiple injuries sustained during the fall, primarily fractures, but without evidence of respiratory compromise or acute infectious processes. Treatment includes medication management, including acetaminophen for pain, oxycodone as needed for pain control, and antibiotics for potential infection, but further diagnostic imaging is recommended before starting treatment to monitor for any complications such as respiratory issues or worsening of the current condition. 

### **Key Points:**

1. **Injury History**: The patient has a history of epilepsy and has had previous surgeries related","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male, with a PMH significant for epilepsy who fell 15 ft w/ head strike and +LOC. His imaging upon admission showed left posterior scalp hematoma/abrasion, frontal scalp laceration, L1-4 transverse process fractures, left 11th rib fracture, and right inferior and superior pubic rami fracture. He was seen by the orthopedics service for his pubic rami fracture, who felt he did not need surgical intervention and weight-bearing as tolerated. He was transferred to the floor hemodynamically stable. His pain was controlled on oral analgesics. ___ were consulted and he was ambulating with crutches. On HD3, he was noted to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea, increased oxygen requirement, and tachycardia to the 160s. CXR, CTA, ABGs, and labs were ordered. He was transferred to the TSICU due to his acute hypoxia. He was weaned off the non-rebreather to hiflow oxygen and eventually nasal cannula. On HD4, he was transferred back to the floor. Patient recuperated well on the floor, he worked with physical therapy which recommended discharge to home. He was weaned off O2 and on ___ was found ready to head home. Patient was instructed regarding warning signs and discharge instructions, he was also instructed to continue his respiratory recovery at home using his IS. He will follow up with us in clinic.

The patient was last admitted from ___ for IVIG and scheduled HD which was tolerated well. In addition, the patient was previously treated with IV vancomycin for staph bacteremia. He completed this course on ___ and was transitioned to minocycline for suppression per ID. In addition, his ruxolitinib was increased from 15mg to 20mg after HD in addition to Vitamin E 100mg TIW. Currently, the patient is feeling well. He has no headache or vision changes. No chest pain or palpitations. No dyspnea. No n/v/d. No fevers/chills. ROS: 10 point review of systems discussed with patient and negative unless noted above <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (PER OMR): ___ has a history of recurrent AML following his matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in ___. He remains in remission since his DLI with development of extensive sclerodermic GVHD. His severe sclerodermatous GVHD is complicated by multiple lower extremity skin infections requiring debridements and prior admissions for wound care and antibiotics. He has been on amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin for presumed skin colonization as directed by Dr. ___ ___; this was changed based on other antibiotics needs. His GVHD has progressed after receiving various immunesuppressant agents. He was started on ruxolitinib, the Jak 2 inhibitor for his GVHD on ___ as part of Protocol ___: Single patient IND of Ruxolitinib in a single patient, MA, with steroid refractory cGVHD. His dose has been adjusted over time, currently 15 mg following his HD, three times per week. He remains on Prednisone 10mg daily; Sirolimus has been discontinued. ___ other issues have been related to increasing shortness of breath requiring repeated admissions as outlined below. This has been in the setting of infections at times, but evaluation by Pulmonary has also shown worsening severe restrictive and obstructive lung disease, consistent with worsening GVHD of the lungs; this is related to sclerodermic GVHD of the chest wall causing restriction, plus possible bronchiolitis obliterans causing obstruction in the lung itself. He also has been noted for sCHF with reduced EF which contributes to his dyspnea, particularly in the setting of increased fluids. He has been followed by Dr. ___. He was on Torsemide for diuresis but often required IV Lasix when inpatient. ___ required a prolonged admission from ___ - ___ with initial issues of increasing cough, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. He was treated for acute on chronic mixed respiratory failure due to CHF exacerbation and pneumonia, acute renal failure, now with HD dependence on MWF hemodialysis schedule, and MRSA bacteremia (grown from port and HD line). Completed a 4-week course daptomycin with dapto locks. The HD line was ultimately replaced due to dehiscence of the tunneling. He developed an acute episode of respiratory distress requiring MICU admission; he was initiated on BiPAP with improvement in respiratory status, and he continues on this as an outpatient, using at night for the most part and during his dialysis. His renal failure was felt to be multi-factorial in the setting of aggressive diuresis for CHF and later with severe infection and sepsis. This was complicated by uremia/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has not needed further diuretics since starting on HD and his most recent echo on ___ with LVEF of 45-50%. His breathing has been better overall with the dialysis but remains tenuous. He has continued on Pulmicort two puffs twice per day, azithromycin and montelukast.

","The patient presented with symptoms of acute illness that resolved without specific diagnosis, including fevers, rash, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Since completing a course of intravenous vancomycin for suspected staph bacteremia, he began receiving intravenous IgG immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion. During his treatment, he experienced respiratory complications that led to prolonged hospitalization. These included a severe reduction in cardiac function indicated by an echocardiogram showing decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of approximately 40%, along with episodes of pulmonary edema, worsening cough, and an elevated pulmonary pressure measured via transpulmonary carbon dioxide (PCO2) monitoring. Due to these findings, his doctor advised him to continue fluid replacement therapy with pulmonary vasopressors and vasopressin. Additionally, he underwent thoracentesis to investigate pleural effusion and subsequent fluid resuscitation and hydration were required to manage acute kidney injury secondary to fluid overload. Despite treatments, the patient continued to experience ongoing respiratory and cardiovascular instability, necessitating further interventions, such as bi-level positive airway support, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, his recent laboratory results indicate persistent inflammatory marker elevation and residual neutropenia despite adequate antibiotic therapy.

The patient was last admitted from ___ for IVIG and scheduled HD which was tolerated well. In addition, the patient was previously treated with IV vancomycin for staph bacteremia. He completed this course on ___ and was transitioned to minocycline for suppression per ID. In addition, his ruxolitinib was increased from 15mg to 20mg after HD in addition to Vitamin E 100mg TIW. Currently, the patient is feeling well. He has no headache or vision changes. No chest pain or palpitations. No dyspnea. No n/v/d. No fevers/chills. ROS: 10 point review of systems discussed with patient and negative unless noted above <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (PER OMR): ___ has a history of recurrent AML following his matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in ___. He remains in remission since his DLI with development of extensive sclerodermic GVHD. His severe sclerodermatous GVHD is complicated by multiple lower extremity skin infections requiring debridements and prior admissions for wound care and antibiotics. He has been on amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin for presumed skin colonization as directed by Dr. ___ ___; this was changed based on other antibiotics needs. His GVHD has progressed after receiving various immunesuppressant agents. He was started on ruxolitinib, the Jak 2 inhibitor for his GVHD on ___ as part of Protocol ___: Single patient IND of Ruxolitinib in a single patient, MA, with steroid refractory cGVHD. His dose has been adjusted over time, currently 15 mg following his HD, three times per week. He remains on Prednisone 10mg daily; Sirolimus has been discontinued. ___ other issues have been related to increasing shortness of breath requiring repeated admissions as outlined below. This has been in the setting of infections at times, but evaluation by Pulmonary has also shown worsening severe restrictive and obstructive lung disease, consistent with worsening GVHD of the lungs; this is related to sclerodermic GVHD of the chest wall causing restriction, plus possible bronchiolitis obliterans causing obstruction in the lung itself. He also has been noted for sCHF with reduced EF which contributes to his dyspnea, particularly in the setting of increased fluids. He has been followed by Dr. ___. He was on Torsemide for diuresis but often required IV Lasix when inpatient. ___ required a prolonged admission from ___ - ___ with initial issues of increasing cough, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. He was treated for acute on chronic mixed respiratory failure due to CHF exacerbation and pneumonia, acute renal failure, now with HD dependence on MWF hemodialysis schedule, and MRSA bacteremia (grown from port and HD line). Completed a 4-week course daptomycin with dapto locks. The HD line was ultimately replaced due to dehiscence of the tunneling. He developed an acute episode of respiratory distress requiring MICU admission; he was initiated on BiPAP with improvement in respiratory status, and he continues on this as an outpatient, using at night for the most part and during his dialysis. His renal failure was felt to be multi-factorial in the setting of aggressive diuresis for CHF and later with severe infection and sepsis. This was complicated by uremia/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has not needed further diuretics since starting on HD and his most recent echo on ___ with LVEF of 45-50%. His breathing has been better overall with the dialysis but remains tenuous. He has continued on Pulmicort two puffs twice per day, azithromycin and montelukast. Recent PFT's showed a decrease further in his DLCO with stable Chest CT. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: * AML -Diagnosed in ___ after having a sore throat, cough and fever. Initially treated with ___ 7+3 regimen with a course complicated by fevers, sinusitis requiring multiple antibiotics, febrile neutropenia, s/p bronchoscopy (all cultures negative), C.Diff colitis, and retinal hemorrhage (from coughing). -Bone marrow biopsy on ___, without remission -Reinduction with MEC. Repeat bone marrow biopsy on day 14 after MEC did not show blasts. -MUD PSCT.

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay! Sincerely, Your ___ team ","The patient presents with symptoms of acute febrile illness following intravenous medication use. The patient reports being acutely intoxicated with cocaine at the time of presentation. A chest X-ray is normal, and blood and urine cultures do not show evidence of infection. Given the patient’s HIV status and previous exposure to various opportunistic infections, including PCP, HCV, and cryptococcal meningitis, the clinical suspicion of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) remains high. The patient’s laboratory results confirm a high HIV-1 RNA level (>10^5 copies/mL), indicating advanced immunosuppression. This scenario necessitates immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the HIV virus and prevent further progression to AIDS. Given the patient’s long-standing pattern of substance misuse and low adherence to current ART regimen, efforts should focus on increasing adherence to improve outcomes. The patient’s physical condition is stable, and no other complications are apparent at this point. Monitoring will continue closely to assess the response to ART and adjust treatment as necessary. Other healthcare resources, including housing support and mental health services, may be considered to address social determinants of health and ongoing substance misuse issues.

**Current Treatment Plan:**

*   Initiate ART with a protease inhibitor (PI) backbone of TDF/FTC + RAL, to effectively target the HIV-1 virus.
*   Increase adherence to the current ART regimen through counseling and management strategies.

1. **Malabsorption of Nutrients**: Given the patient's history of iron deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism, malabsorption of essential nutrients such as iron and vitamins might contribute to her current symptoms.
2. **Postoperative Infection or Adhesions**: Post-surgery infections or adhesions around the stomach could lead to inflammation, leading to pain and discomfort.
3. **Bleeding Complications**: Bleeding during the procedure or as a result of the removal of excess stomach lining might cause nausea and vomiting.
4. **Gastrointestinal Motility Disorders**: Postoperative gastrointestinal motility issues could lead to nausea and discomfort.
5. **Other Conditions**:",This is a ___ yo F admitted to the hospital after a lap gastric bypass. There were no intraoperative complications. Her post operative course was uneventful.

Mediastinal contour is stable. Bony structures are intact. IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly with mild hilar congestion. Tiny pleural effusions. ECHO ___: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation (inferior free wall is frankly akinetic) (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to global contractile dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, dyssynchrony. A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transthoracic study with transpulmonic microbubble contrast is recommended to better define the endocardium of the left ventricle. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, left ventricular contractile function is now severely impaired.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear ___, You were admitted to the hospital because you had been feeling short of breath and you were found to have fluid on your lungs. This was due to a condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up into your lungs. The cause of this is still unclear. Many tests were sent but did not show a clear cause. You were given a diuretic medication through the IV to help get the fluid out. You were also found to have a blood clot in your heart. This was treated with blood thinners. You will continue injections of enoxaparin (Lovenox) until your warfarin (Coumadin) levels come up. When you were ready to leave the hospital, you were set up with a device to monitor your heart. You will follow up closely with our heart failure specialists to continue to manage this issue. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below) - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Weigh yourself every morning, seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night. It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the best! -Your ___ Care Team ","The patient presents with symptoms of dyspnea and chest tightness that worsened over time, accompanied by weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath during exertion, as evidenced by a cough producing sputum (DOE), and findings consistent with pneumonia. A chest X-ray revealed an enlarged left side and small right side of the heart, suggesting heart failure. Laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels indicating myocardial damage. Additionally, there are hyperlipidemia and atypical labored breathing, which suggests pulmonary hypertension. The patient has a history of obesity and previous hypertension. The physical examination reveals signs of cardiac enlargement, including tachycardia and increased jugular venous pressure (JVP). The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate renal impairment. 

### **Key Points and Recommendations:**

- **Initial Treatment:** 
  - Administering nitroglycerin for chest pain
  - Monitoring for worsening of symptoms
  - Starting statins to manage cholesterol
  - Transferring to Heart Failure Service for further management of heart failure symptoms
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Monitor for worsening of symptoms
  - Continue monitoring kidney function and blood urea nitrogen levels
  - Adjust medication according to response to nitroglycerin and other treatments
  - Consider imaging studies for further evaluation of cardiac size and structure if indicated

### **Patient Education and Prevention:**

- Encourage patient education about lifestyle changes (diet","BRIEF COURSE: ___ with limited PMH presented with DOE and orthopnea 3 weeks after viral URI. Found to have BNP 6915, CXR with cardiomegaly, pulm vascular congestion, small b/l pleural effusions.

Work-up negative for non-ischemic cuases: HIV negative, iron studies normal, SPEP normal, ___ negative, TSH normal, Free ___ normal. Ddx still includes viral myocarditis vs idiopathic. ECHO with lumison showed large LV thrombus. Defering cath at this time given LV thrombus, but will need CAD ruled out definitively in future with LHC. Also would benefit from cardiac MR to evaluate for myocarditis, scar as outpatient. She was diuresied with Lasix IV 20 mg to dry weight of 80.2 kg and started on metoprolol succ 12.5 mg and lisinopril 5 mg, then uptitrated to 10 mg, which were well tolerated. She was discharged with a Life Vest after discussion with the patient and her family. Consideration should be given to early CRT depending upon her clinical and ECHO response to ___ medical therapy given that she is female with likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a relatively wide LBBB. Her medical regimen at discharge included: - Lasix 20mg daily - Metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg - Lisinopril 10 mg daily (consider switch to ___ if persistent dry cough) - Consider the addition of spironolactone after titration of the beta-blocker and ACEi. # LV Thrombus: ECHO with lumison ___ showed large (2.3 x 0.9 cm) mural thrombus along the apical inferior left ventricular wall. ___ new HFrEF. Started on warfarin 5 mg and Enoxaparin 80 mg q12h ___. Goal INR 2.0-3.0 Continue enoxaparin until 2 therapeutic INRs as an outpatient. She will need at least ___ months of anticoagulation and follow up TTE/CMR to assess for resolution of the LV thrombus. # Transaminitis: ALT elevated to 56 on admission, previously normal. Likely congestive hepatopathy in setting of HFrEF. Resolved with diuresis. # ?Asthma: Continued home fluticasone inh BID, alb neb PRN =========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - New Meds: Lovenox, warfarin, metoprolol succinate, lisinopril, furosemide - Post-Discharge Follow-up Labs Needed: INR within 2 days, Chem 10 within ___ weeks to check Cr - Discharge weight: 80.2 kg - Discharge diuretic: Furosemide 20 mg daily - New HFrEF: Unclear etiology, likely non-ischemic. Will need LHC down the road but deferred for now given LV thrombus. Should have cardiac MR as ___. Should consider ICD vs CRT given prolonged QRS if EF does not recover. - Diuresis: Pt was euvolemic on discharge at weight above. Will need evaluation within 7 days to determine need for adjusting diuretic. - Lisinopril: Pt developed cough after initiating lisinopril. If persists, could consider ___ - LV thrombus: D/c on warfarin 5 mg and enoxaparin 80 q12h - Iron deficiency: Ferritin 75.

On exam patient has psychomotor retardation, a dysphoric affect and states that his mood is depressed. His admission labs were wnl and his chronic nausea has been extensively worked up without finding a source. It is possible that patient's nausea is a somatic delusion, especially with a negative extensive medical workup. Differential is depressive psychosis vs delusional do. Patient was continued on his home medications of clonazepam (1mg in AM and 0.5 in afternoon) and phenelzine 45mg BID. Ziprazodone was discontinued and 5mg of aripiprazole was started on ___. Aripiprazole was titrated to a dose of 7.5 on discharge and he tolerated it without side effects. Dr. ___ team was contacted and patient recieved ECT on ___, and ___ without reported side effects. Medical: #Chronic nausea- No acute issues, still with chronic nausea slightly improved with ECT. Continued home Prilosec 20 mg bid and Zantac 300 mg qhs. He was also given Zofran ODT 4mg bid PRN for nausea, although this did not help. #BPH- continued pt's home meds: tamsulosin 0.4 bid, Avodart 0.5 mg daily Collateral: Spoke with outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. ___. Dr. ___ has been treating patient since ___. Patient frequently makes SI comments that he wants to die because of his intractable nausea. However, patient has never acted on these urges/comments or been psychiatrically hospitalized. Psychiatrist says that he believes patient's nausea is associated with his depression. The nausea has been extensively worked up in past, both by gastroenterology and PCP, and has never revealed any pathology. Dr. ___ that nausea may be a manifestation of psychotic depression, and this is why he referred patient for ECT. Dr. ___ that patient has cluster A traits such as becoming paranoid and he never speaks of friends/family. Dr. ___ that he would prefer Mr. ___ to engage in psychotherapy as well as continuing to see to Dr. ___ psychiatric follow up. Spoke with PCP, ___. PCP relates that patient is relatively new to her. He has previously been extensively worked up in past for nausea ___ years. He had celiac/ h pylori workup that was negative. He has had both colonoscopy and EGD (___ last year) that was nonremarkable, but with a slight hiatial hernia. She has tried zantac/prilosec on him, but these do not seem to help. PCP has also done abdominal MRI, that did not reveal any pathology. She was considering referring him to GI again for furthur workup. PCP agrees that nausea seems linked with depression. PCP also said that in past patient has endorsed suicidal ideation, but he would say he had no intent to kill himself and he never had a plan. Risk Assessment: Patient is at moderate chronic risk of harm to self. Pt has no prior hospitalizations, SAs, family history of SA, no hx of impulsivity or substance use, and is help seeking. However, pt is also an unmarried white, elderly male living alone, has questionable reality testing ability, has frequent SI related to his intolerable and intractable nausea (and has hopelessness and anxiety regarding this), and has the means to act on his plan. It was reassuring to hear from the patient's psychiatrist and PCP, both say that patient's SI is a recurrent problem that is not new, suggesting that patient is at an elevated chronic risk to self, but his imminent risk is low/unchanged. While on Deaconness 4 patient's risk factors were modified by ECT therapy and change to aripiprazole for better cotnrol of both mood and delusions. He was encouraged to participate in outpatient psychotherapy. He reports that if he begins to feel worse he will go to the ___ 1 mile from his house. ","user

They would also like to see you in their clinic in 1 week. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy worked with you, and recommended you be discharged to rehab to regain your strength. You are now medically cleared for discharge, please note the following discharge instructions: Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency Department for any of the following: *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness. *New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze. *If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications. *You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing. *You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a bowel movement. *You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your urine, or experience a discharge. *Your pain in not improving within ___ hours or is not gone within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or back. *You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius. *Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you. Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take any new medications as prescribed. Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. ","The patient presented with severe pain in her wrists, left hand, hips, and face after a traumatic fall, which caused facial trauma, bruising, and ecchymosis. She also experienced significant postoperative complications following surgical procedures. Key findings include bilateral cervical spine injury, neurological symptoms, and signs of kidney failure and hypovolemic shock.

### **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Initial Assessment**: The patient's clinical presentation suggested a traumatic injury with possible spinal cord injury, given the nature of the falls and the involvement of multiple body parts. Postoperative complications and prolonged postoperative period raised concern for potential neurologic compromise.

2. **Physical Examination**: Physical examination revealed signs of thoracic and abdominal trauma (hemorrhage), including bruising, ecchymosis, and slight weakness or pain in the upper limbs. Additionally, there were signs of dehydration and altered mental status.

3. **Imaging Studies**: The radiographic evidence confirmed cervical spine injury, including a transverse process fracture and fractures around the nasals and mastoid process. There were also some indications of a long-term orthopedic history.

4. **Laboratory Values**: Blood tests showed a significant drop in platelet count and mild elevation in creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalance indicated by hyperkalemia, likely due to hemodilution.

5. **Discharge Orders**: The patient was prescribed anticoagulation to prevent further thrombosis, antibiotics (clindamycin),","___ with PMH afib on Coumadin, prior CVAs ___ no residual deficits), cerebral aneurysm, renal cell cancer s/p cryoablation, CHF, gait instability uses walker who presented s/p mechanical fall ___ with mildy displaced right C2 tranverse process fracture, and left ___ phalanx fracture. Also noted to have a nasal bone fracture. The patient is hemodynamically stable. She was seen by Neurosurgery who recommended nonoperative management of the C1 fracture, hard cervical collar for ___ weeks and outpatient follow-up for repeat films. Hand surgery saw the patient for the phalanx fracture who splinted the finger and recommended outpatient follow-up in 1 week. The patient was admitted for ___ consult and pain control. On HD1, the tertiary survey revealed no other injuries. Physical Therapy worked with the patient, and recommended rehab once medically stable. During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently with the help of nursing, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay. The patient's INR was noted to be supratherapeutic on HD4 (___) so Coumadin was held. The patients INR ___ was 2.4, she will receive 2.5 mg Coumadin at 1400. Repeat INR ordered for ___. At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with walker assistance, and voiding without difficulty. She continues to get headaches frequently, getting Tylenol for pain with minimal effect. She was educated that these headaches are likely due to her cervical fracture and may persist while this fracture is healing. Her Tylenol was changed from PRN to scheduled to improve with breakthrough pain. The patient will be discharged to rehab. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions. She will be following up with Urology outpatient regarding hematuria, and with hand surgery outpatient. ","user

After his last dialysis session (during which 1L was removed), the patient had 30 min of chest tightness. This was associated with shortness of breath, palpitations, and weakness that lasted 2 hours. He also endorsed lightheadedness when standing and blurry vision, which have since resolved. The patient came to the ED, where a pacemaker interrogation was performed by EP, demonstrating normal pacer function with 98.6% AS-VP. Troponin was 0.14 and MB was 5. Cardiology recommended admission, but the patient left AMA to take his daughter to an appointment. He returned shortly thereafter and agreed to be admitted. The patient also has a chronic non-healing left great toe wound that has been painful for the past 10 months and has become more swollen and productive of yellow discharge over the past week. He was evaluated by podiatry and planned for a partial amputation. In the ED, initial VS were 98.2 78 128/69 15 97RA.

Sincerely, Your ___ Care Team ","The patient presents with a recent episode of chest tightness and shortness of breath during a dialysis session, diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction. Post-dialysis symptoms included a fall in blood pressure and hemoglobin levels (normal) indicating hemolytic anemia. A previous medical history of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) use, parathyroid surgery, and previous lower extremity vascular events. Current complaint includes intermittent symptoms of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), such as right leg ulcers and poor peripheral circulation. The patient's primary complaint is related to his symptoms from his history of dialysis. Following a diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, he underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of a pacemaker and anticoagulation therapy. However, he is now complaining of foot pain and swelling in both feet. Upon evaluation, there is significant inflammation (fever, elevated white cell count) in the bloodstream, consistent with pyuria. Initial examination findings show bilateral pericarditis with minimal effusion and normal heart murmurs. Laboratory results show normocytic anemia with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Recent medication side effects may be contributing to the current symptoms. 

### **Summary Explanation:**

This case presentation represents a clinical scenario involving patients experiencing episodes of chest tightness followed by shortness of breath, coupled with other symptoms such as tachycardia and pedal edema. The patient's medical","___ with NICM (EF ___, AF/SSS/VT on warfarin and amiodarone s/p ICD to CRT, ESRD on HD, admitted for presyncope after dialysis and chronic dry gangrene of right hallux. # Presyncope Likely orthostasis since occurred with standing after 1L removed at HD. Pacemaker interrogation was negative for arrhythmia. He had no further chest pain or palpitations during his hospitalization and there was no evidence of cardiac ischemia, decompensated heart failure, PE, TIA, or seizure. # Right hallux dry gangrene He also underwent a partial right hallux amputation for chronic dry gangrene. The patient remained afebrile and without exam or radiographic signs of infection.

After his last dialysis session (during which 1L was removed), the patient had 30 min of chest tightness. This was associated with shortness of breath, palpitations, and weakness that lasted 2 hours. He also endorsed lightheadedness when standing and blurry vision, which have since resolved. The patient came to the ED, where a pacemaker interrogation was performed by EP, demonstrating normal pacer function with 98.6% AS-VP. Troponin was 0.14 and MB was 5. Cardiology recommended admission, but the patient left AMA to take his daughter to an appointment. He returned shortly thereafter and agreed to be admitted. The patient also has a chronic non-healing left great toe wound that has been painful for the past 10 months and has become more swollen and productive of yellow discharge over the past week. He was evaluated by podiatry and planned for a partial amputation. In the ED, initial VS were 98.2 78 128/69 15 97RA.

","The patient presents with symptoms of chronic right back pain radiating down the left leg following major surgery for recurrent lower extremity peripheral vascular disease. The patient's history includes multiple medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypercholesterolemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, recurrent deep vein thrombosis, heart failure, coronary artery disease, desmosynthetic dysplasia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and non-healing venous ulcers. His current presentation includes chronic right back pain that has worsened over time. He has undergone a previous below-knee bypass grafting and currently uses a combination of medication, including warfarin for anticoagulation and aspirin for antiplatelet therapy, as well as medications for various comorbidities. Given these complexities, management involves closely monitoring his cardiovascular risk factors and addressing the ongoing acute problem of chronic pain, while considering alternative treatment options for his chronic health issues. His laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hemoglobin, indicating inflammation and anemia, and slightly elevated liver enzymes, suggesting possible liver dysfunction or renal impairment. It is noted that there are residual complications from previous surgeries such as venous ulcers, which may impact quality of life and necessitate further intervention.

### **Key Points:**

- Chronic back pain suggests ongoing musculoskeletal and possibly","Mr. ___ underwent an angiogram on ___ which showed Patent right superficial femoral artery, greater than 90% stenosis of the femoral popliteal, proximal vein graft anastomosis and greater than 90% stenosis of the distal vein graft at the distal anastomosis with the dorsalis pedis.

You required a short term intubation while you were admitted. You received several sessions of plasmapheresis which helped your symptoms. Your medications were also adjusted ___ order to better control your myasthemia. These changes were made by neuromuscular specialists who were consulted to help with your care. MEDICATION CHANGES: Prednisone increased to 60mg daily Azathioprine started 200mg daily STOPPED Mestinon Please follow up with your neurologist shortly after discharge. ","The patient presents with progressive worsening symptoms including dysarthria, dysphagia, shortness of breath, and diplopia, along with ptosis, strabismus, and bilateral facial weakness. Recent onset of increasing shortness of breath suggests an acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. 

Clinical examination reveals atrophy of the left orbicularis oculi muscle, possibly indicating involvement of cranial nerve III. While there's a significant improvement in ptosis and some slight reduction in vocal cord adduction and depression, the majority of ptosis remains. The patient's dysarthria indicates upper motor neuron involvement. Dysphagia likely due to involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerves or pharynx. The absence of cervical spine tenderness and normal cervical spine examination does not support a spinal tumor. Oral thrush is present. The presence of focal weakness in the face, especially involving the muscles innervated by cranial nerve III (oculomotor), and the pattern of weakness suggest myasthenia gravis. This condition often involves the thymus gland and may be associated with autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto thyroiditis. It can be triggered by certain medications, notably corticosteroids such as azathioprine, and sometimes mycophenolate mofetil. Symptoms improve with discontinuation of these drugs and replacement therapy with immunosuppressive medication if necessary. Treatment options for this condition include intravenous immunoglobulin and","Mr. ___ is a ___ yo gentleman with history of oculobulbar myasthenia, on prednisone and recently added on azathioprine, who presented with one day of worsening shortness of breath ___ setting of one month of progressively worsening dysarthria, dysphagia, ptosis, and diplopia. The precipitating cause for this was unclear, but the subacute decline despite uptitration of immunosuppressive medications was concerning and the patient was admitted to the Neurology ICU. # Myasthenia Crisis The patient's exam showed significant bulbar and proximal weakness over the course of many days and required intubation shortly after admission to the hospital. He underwent plasmapheresis x 5 sessions (___). Neuromuscular specialists were consulted for treatment recommendations, with the following changes: azathioprine 200 mg daily, prednisone 60 mg daily, stop mestinon. TPMT activity normal, CT chest negative for thymoma, per outpatient neurologist. . Patient was initially NPO because of significant bulbar weaknees, with NS @ 75cc/hr. Once the patient was intubated, an OG was placed and TF were started. After extubation, he was evaluated by speech and swallow and passed - able to tolerate a regular diet which he will continue after discharge. . Physical therapy also worked with the patient and felt that he had no deficits after several inpatient ___ deficits and was safe for home discharge. . # Pulmonary - Respiratory failure, mixed Patient was intubated on ___ due to respiratory muscle fatigue, increasing O2 requirement, and increasing hypercarbia. He had increased secretion despite discontinuing mestinon. There was concern for aspiration pneumonitis causing elevated WBC but CXR was negative for aspiration or atelectasis. The patient had yellow mucoid secretions and was monitored closely for pneumonia. BAL showed no growth. Antibiotics were given for several days and then were discontinued. . # ID The patient was febrile to 100.8 on ___. Respiratory and urine cx were sent and returned negative. Empiric Abx with vanc/cefepime were started but DCed once culures returned negative. . # Blood pressure Patient was on continuous telemetry monitoring, with no acute events. Lisinopril was initially continued on admission but then held because of soft pressures after intubation; he was on low dose phenylephrine while on propofol, but the pressor was weaned off after 3 days. He was resumed on his lisinopril on discharge. . # Endocrine Home metformin was held due to need for multiple medication changes and tests that could affect renal function. The patient was treated with insulin SS. Metformin was reinstated and tolerated well prior to discharge. . # TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # - Increased prednisone to 60mg daily - Increased azathioprine to 200mg daily - Stopped Mestinon ","user

Patient reports that he had been well controlled on oral prednisone alone for the past year and had been slowly weaned down to 7.5mg daily with plan to stop it by his primary neurologist. However ___ early ___, he had recurrence of his symptoms, namely left greater than right ptosis, intermittent diplopia, and mild difficulty swallowing and speaking, with slurring of his words. He was seen by his neurologist numerous times and ___ the ED once which resulted ___ incremental increase ___ prednisone to 30mg daily (currently) and resumption of mestinon ___ late ___. His symptoms initially improved with each increase, but overall continued to worsen. On ___ he was started on azathioprine (as mycophenolate was rejected by insurance company). Over the past 3 weeks, his symptoms have progressively worsened to the point that he cannot tolerate solid foods and has been limiting himself to soup and water. His ptosis and double vision have become more constant. He is also easily fatigued and has stopped working and ambulating as much. He describes it being harder to get up and walk, which he attributes to a combination of generalized weakness and dyspnea on exertion. His voice is becoming softer and more slurred, per his son, but he has no difficulty comprehending or producing language. His breathing has also been more difficult, and he cannot breathe when laying flat, which has led to insomnia. Over the past 24 hours, he felt that his breathing has become more labored and became very worried, therefore he presented to ___, where he was placed on supplemental oxygen for mild desaturation to ___ and was transferred here for further care. ROS is otherwise significant for intermittent nonbloody diarrhea for the past month attributed to the mestinon which improved with loperamide given by his PCP. He also endorses increased oral secretions, but no cough or sputum, and no fevers, chills, night sweats. He endorses mild frontal headache and visual symptoms as described above. Denies focal weakness apart from what is described above, dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, bowel or bladder incontinence. He describes only tongue numbness, but no other sensory loss or paresthesias. Denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, urinary frequency. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> Oculobulbar myasthenia ___, +AChR Abs Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Hyperlipidemia BPH <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> HTN, HLD.

You have recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. You will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these results they will contact you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that you will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation. You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen which are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called Dermabond. These are healing well however it is important that you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. Please call the office if you develop any of these symptoms or a fever. You may go to the emergency room if your symptoms are severe. You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with steri-strips (little white adhesive strips) instead of Dermabond, these will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming for 6 weeks after surgery unless told otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___. You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication oxycodone. Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car while taking narcotic pain medication. No heavy lifting greater than 6 lbs for until your first post-operative visit after surgery. Please no strenuous activity until this time unless instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___. Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Good luck! ","The patient presents with a long-standing history of ulcerative colitis, which began six months prior, and has evolved into a more severe condition characterized by significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition, necessitating nutritional support. Despite initial treatments, including steroids and biologics, the patient's symptoms remain uncontrolled. The patient was initially treated with intravenous abx, but has since been switched to oral metronidazole due to concerns regarding biologic therapy. On their current admission, the patient shows signs of end-stage disease, including mucosal inflammation, systemic symptoms such as fever and fatigue, and gastrointestinal disturbances like diarrhea and incontinence. The flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed diffuse mucosal ulceration and erythema consistent with ulcerative colitis. Pathological examination confirms chronic moderately active colitis without granulomas or dysplasia. Imaging studies reveal circumferential wall thickening and distant lymphadenopathy indicative of chronic inflammation. Clinical judgment suggests this case represents stage IV colorectal cancer, potentially related to the underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Further management will require comprehensive systemic treatment, considering immunomodulatory therapies to control both the inflammation and the cancer, alongside nutritional interventions and supportive care to manage end-stage conditions.","___ F past medical history of atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, latent TB on INH, ulcerative colitis, presented with non-focal weakness and diarrhea. # Diarrhea: Loose, occasionally bloody stools without mucus and associated abdominal pain but no upper GI symptoms. GI was consulted, and the case was staffed with her outpatient gastroenterologist. She had negative stool cultures. She underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy, the findings of which were consistent with active ulcerative colitis (pathology similarly consistent with UC). CT scan showed colonic inflammation to the splenic flexure, consistent with a UC flare. Colorectal was consulted, with plan for surgery. She underwent a laparoscopic proctocolectomy with end ileostomy on ___. She tolerated the procedure well with no complications and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. Please see the operative note for technical details. Postop, her pain was initially controlled with a dilaudid PCA then she was switched to oral pain meds. Her diet was initially advanced to clears on POD#1 but he became nauseous from this was was made NPO again. She was then advanced slowly till she was tolerating a regular diet. On POD#7, she c/o urinary urgency and a UA showed large luekocytes so she was given ceftriaxone for one day then switched to 3 day course of ciprofloxacin. The days afterwards were spent encouraging her to increase her PO intake, working with a dietician and continuing TPN. By POD#11, she was ambulating with assistance, tolerating regular diet and her pain was controlled with oral pain meds so she was deemd fit for discharge to a rehab facility. # Hypokalemia: Ongoing hypokalemia associated with continued diarrhea. She was repleted twice to three times daily while being monitored on telemetry. # Weakness: Nonfocal neurologic exam throughout with negative head CT and no signs or symptoms of sepsis. Most likely due to deconditioning and ongoing diarrheal losses. Patient refused to work with Physical Therapy while on the ___ but was willing to ambulate and get OOB after surgery. Her nutrition was supplemented with Ensure and she was started on TPN postop. She was also given Megace to help stimulate her appetite; calorie counts were ordered and she was seen by a dietician to advice her on the best types of foods to consume to maximize caloric intake. # Acute on Chronic Anemia: Likely having small GI losses from her ulcerative colitis with low iron stores from poor nutrition. Because she is a Jehovah's Witness, she will not accept blood products; a signed acknowledgement of this was placed in her chart, and confirmed with her HCP/daughter. # Latent TB: Patient had been started on INH in preparation for starting Remicade; however, after biologic therapy was determined not to be an option for her, patient opted to discontinue her INH. # Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS-VASC of ___ with history of stroke putting her at high thromboembolic risk. Xarelto was stopped pre-operatively in favor of heparin gtt... Her home metoprolol was continued (except when held for low blood pressures responsive to IV fluids as above). Postop, heparin gtt was stopped and levenox was restarted. She was restarted on metoprolol to control her atrial fibrillation after surgery. She will restart Xarelto after discharge. # Glaucoma: Continued home dose eye drops. # Hypertension: Held home Norvasc given normotension (with occasional episodes of hypotension). Amlodipine restarted after surgery ","user

If bleeding stops, call vascular office. If bleeding does not stop, call ___ for transfer to closest Emergency Room. ","The patient presented with symptoms of aorto-esophageal fistula presenting at age 56 with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosed using CT angiography and confirmed with CTCAO following an initial screening CTA showing a 5.5 cm aneurysm. The patient reported no recent trauma or significant changes in his condition but was experiencing intermittent claudication and shortness of breath during periods of increased activity. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and diverticulitis. Physical examination revealed mild hypertension, bradycardia, and splanchnic artery pulselessness, suggestive of aortic insufficiency. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram did not show evidence of cardiac disease. The patient's laboratory results were all normal except for mildly elevated creatinine levels. 

The patient underwent endovascular aneurysm repair due to the high risk of rupture given the size of the aneurysm and previous complications. 
He experienced some mild pain post-operatively and was able to recover fully after one week post-surgery.
In the immediate post-operative period, the patient remained under close observation for a further 10 days before being discharged home. 
Follow-up appointments scheduled to monitor the healing of the graft and watch for signs of endocarditis were recommended, as well as check the stent-graft patency.","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with AAA who was admitted to the ___ on ___. The patient was taken to the endovascular suite and underwent FEVAR. For details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the ICU at which time the patients lumbar drain was capped, SBPs were controlled briefly on/off nitro and eventually off nitro. On POD#1 we obtained a CTA which was negative for an endoleak, the patient was on a regular diet, drain was capped and we decided that the patient should stay in the ICU overnight. On POD#2, the patients drain came out, we removed the patients foley, A-line and moved the patient to our VICU. On POD#3 the patient was ambulating well and ready for discharge home. Post-operatively, he did well without any groin swelling. He was able to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and ambulate without assistance, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions. ","user

","Mr. ___________ is admitted for symptoms of pain control after a mid-pole splenic embolization for symptomatic splenomegaly following a recent episode of pneumonia likely induced by immunodeficiency as well as sinusitis. He is taking cyclosporine modified at 100mg twice daily. In addition, he received intravenous vancomycin, Zosyn, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone for a week. He also takes weekly aranesp injections for bone marrow suppression. 

### **Analysis:** 
The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which appears to be related to his past liver transplantation. The laboratory results show elevated serum creatinine and bilirubin levels indicating renal impairment, while electrolyte imbalances suggest dehydration and metabolic acidosis. The patient's treatment plan includes administration of intravenous vancomycin, Zosyn, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone for a week, followed by weekly aranesp injections for bone marrow suppression, which may contribute to GVHD. Management should focus on controlling GVHD through immunosuppressive therapy and supportive care, including hydration and nutritional support. Monitoring of liver function tests, kidney function, and electrolyte levels is crucial during this period to prevent further complications. Additionally, the use of vancomycin should be continued until the patient is fully weaned off intravenous medication to prevent potential complications such as Clostr","Mr. ___ was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service under Dr. ___ on ___ for pain control after a splenic artery embolization done by the Interventional Radiology service. He received PO Dilaudid and standing tylenol for pain control during his hospital stay. On the morning of ___, his Hct was 19.4, a repeat Hct was 18.6. He was given 2u pRBCs. A post-transfusion Hct was 22. He spiked to 102.7 for which he was pan-cultred. CXR was negative for pneumonia. IV Zosyn was started for empiric coverage. Right groin puncture site pain was persistent. U/S of the area identified a 2.5 cm partially thrombosed right groin pseudoaneurysm, with a neck measuring 3 mm in width. Hct decreased to 19 again. IV Vitamin K was given for INR of 2.9. An abdominal CT was also done demonstrating just ascites. Post CT, creatinine increased to 3.9. He was bloused with IV fluid for low urine output. ___ then embolized the pseudoaneurysm on ___. Postop, embolization, right groin appeared ecchymotic with positive distal pulses. He had less pain in the right groin. Hct was down to 17. Two units of PRBC were transfused with post hct of 23. Postop transfusion, he had an 8 beat run of VTach that resolved. Calcium repletion was given for calcium of 7.5. Hct stabilized at ___. LFTs were notable of rise in t.bili to 3.9. ERCP was done on to interrogate the metal stent on ___. It was noted that the previously placed metal stent had migrated, a CBD anastomotic stricture was noted and a new MS was placed. He tolerated this procedure well and diet was advanced to regular the next day. A repeat U/S of the groin was done on ___lood flow at the neck of the pseudoaneurysm which may represent a small arterial branch vessel. No documented flow within the body of the pseudoaneurysm. He continued to have discomfort at this site as well as abdominal and back pain for which he was receiving po Dilaudid. He was taking a total of ___ per day of the Dilaudid. The plan was to send him home with a script for dilaudid 2mg prn every 8 hours with only 10 tabs. Of note, the anemia/hemolysis w/u was negative. He received a total of 3 units of prbc. Leukopenia was improving. Blood and urine cultures were negative to date. Creatinine increased and this was likely related to the contrast given during the angiogram. Creatinine increased to 3.9, but had decreased to 3.0 on the day of discharge. Potassium was elevated to 5.4. He was instructed to follow a low potassium diet, have his labs checked on ___ and to resume the Florinef. Weight was 77kg up from admission weight of 71kg. Urine output was averaging 400cc/day. A repeat right groin U/S should be done one week from ___ to assess pseudoaneurysm. At time of discharge, vitals signs were stable, he was a regular diet, ambulating independently. ","user

You underwent a pharmacological stress test which did not show any new problems in your heart function. It is possible that you are experience some spasm in the arteries in your heart. We have started you on some medicines to treat this condition. Please see the attached list for changes made to your medications. ","The patient presents with chest pain that radiates to the back and worsens at rest, associated with shortness of breath, dyspnea, and mild nausea and vomiting. These symptoms began two weeks prior to the acute event when he underwent a cardiac catheterization showing total occlusion of the right coronary artery. Subsequent to admission, he developed worsening chest pain that started shortly after medical management following the procedure. Physical examination reveals bilateral periorbital edema, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and low albumin levels, suggesting myocardial injury consistent with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation and left bundle branch block, indicating acute coronary syndrome. His clinical presentation is suggestive of acute pericarditis. Laboratory tests show mild troponin elevation, indicating cardiac damage, and slightly decreased potassium levels may suggest hypokalemia.

### **Summary Conclusion:** 
Given the patient's acute presentation of chest pain, significantly elevated troponin levels, and evidence of acute coronary syndrome on the electrocardiogram, it is highly likely that the patient has suffered a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, further increasing his risk for cardiovascular events. Acute pericarditis is strongly suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, particularly the presence of elevated troponin levels and significant chest pain without significant ST","___ y/o man with PMHx CAD c/b STEMI ___ - posterolateral ventricular branch of the right coronary artery now s/p BMS), Ulcerative Colitis, HTN and HLD presenting with CP in the setting of a known totally occluded RCA at recent ___ cath. # Chest pain/CAD: Given significant cardiac history and concern for unstable angina, patient was initially on a heparin and nitro drip. Home pravastatin was changed transiently to high dose atorvastatin while there was concern for possible ACS/NSTEMI. Metoprolol, aspirin, and IMDUR were continued. Admission EKG was unchanged from prior, serial cardiac enzymes were drawn and remained flat so heparin and nitro were discontinued. On hospital day 1, chest pain recurred while patient was lying in bed. EKG at the time showed TWIs in precordial leads. Patient was restarted on heparin gtt. He was taken for a nuclear stress on ___ that showed no reversible areas of ischemia. He was discharged with nitro SL for symptomatic use and he was also put on amlodipine in case symptoms might be related to coronary vasospasm. Patient's metoprolol was stopped in the setting of SBPs in ___ and starting amlodipine. # ?CHF: most recent ECHO prior to admission showed preserved EF, repeat ECHO done in house showed EF 50-55%. Patient was noted to have slight L>R swelling in ___, LENIs were done which showed no DVT. Patient remained on home lasix and lisinopril and continued to remain euvolemic. # HTN: continued lisinopril, metoprolol, imdur. # HLD: substituted atorvastatin for pravastatin as above # BPH: continued tamsulosin TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Outpatient team can decide whether pt would benefit from beta blocker, as it was stopped on this admission, in the setting of low systolic blood pressures and starting amlodipine ","user

You were admitted because you had chest pain. You were taken to the cath lab, where luckily they found no residual heart disease. You had an echocardiogram that also showed that your heart is pumping very well. We suggest continuing to take aspirin, propranolol and atorvastatin for now for heart protection. You were also found to have a heart rhythm called ""atrial fibrillation."" This condition is associated with a risk of strokes. Apixaban, and other blood thinners, can help decrease this risk substantially. Please continue to take your apixaban. Please follow up with your primary care doctor about the results of your pleural biopsy. They will determine from there with what specialty to follow up with for ongoing monitoring and care. It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. We wish you well! ","This patient presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain following a day of yoga, presenting with symptoms of a possible heart attack and nausea, along with symptoms suggesting a pulmonary embolism on CT-guided pleural mass biopsy. Upon admission, she reported anxiety regarding medication administration due to family history of intracranial bleeding and cardiovascular disease, including previous heart attacks. 

The physical examination revealed no evidence of signs of cardiac distress and hypotension, but mild radiation into the upper back suggested potential trauma to the spine. Laboratory results included elevated creatinine levels, suggesting renal impairment, but otherwise, vital signs remained stable throughout the period of care. Electrocardiogram findings indicated normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and morphology, though there was a notable electrocardiographic conduction disturbance noted at 90 seconds in one of two leads; however, it resolved spontaneously.

The echocardiogram found no evidence of any major cardiac issues, although there were some minor variations in chamber dimensions and wall motion, particularly the right ventricle showing slight dilation and decreased systolic function. The patient received medications such as metoclopramide and diphenhydramine for symptomatic relief, which improved her condition.

In terms of imaging studies, the ejection fraction was measured via transthoracic echocardiography, yielding an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 65%. Furthermore, imaging of the aorta and the right ventricle confirmed their respective anatomy and functions.","___ healthy other than HTN admitted for chest pain and trop elevation to 0.54.

Though initial ultrasounds of your leg did not show blood clots in the lower leg, a CT scan of your pelvis revealed a 2-cm clot in your external iliac vein. You may have a higher tendency to form clots given your history of cancer and radiation to your bladder. We started you on a blood thinning medication called Coumadin (Warfarin) which you will continue for 6 months. Your INR level is a measure of how well your blood is being thinned and your goal level is ___. You will need to have this checked frequently and your dose adjusted accordingly. Until you INR level is therapeutic, you should continue to take Lovenox injections twice daily as you have been doing in the hospital. You will have your bloodwork checked on ___. You will follow with your PCP and Dr. ___ at the dates/times below. We have made the following changes to your medications: - Take Lovenox injections (110mg) at 8am and 8pm every day until your INR is ___ - Take Coumadin 10mg daily and get your INR level measured frequently - Continue the rest of your home medications ","The patient presents with a two-week history of intermittent leg swelling and pain following an incident involving a sharp object, as reported by the patient. The physical examination revealed significant peripheral edema, erythema, and warmth in the left leg and flank region. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, urea nitrogen, and electrolyte abnormalities. These findings suggest possible kidney injury secondary to severe pain and decreased renal function, potentially resulting from prolonged ischemia due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) secondary to a traumatic event. The initial imaging studies confirm a thrombus within the left external iliac vein without evidence of bleeding complications, suggesting possible pulmonary embolism as a complication but not confirmed due to lack of clinical signs. 

**Assessment Conclusion:**  
Based on this patient’s presentation and investigation, it appears that he suffered from acute kidney injury likely resulting from severe pain causing vasoconstriction leading to hypotension, followed by kidney injury secondary to ischemia secondary to DVT, confirming that the most likely cause is deep vein thrombosis rather than pulmonary embolism. Management may involve continuing anticoagulation, renal replacement therapy if needed, addressing underlying cardiac conditions. Close monitoring for complications, considering ongoing management of hypertension, diabetes, and current medical treatments, including medications such as amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and low-dose aspirin to reduce stroke risk. Given the high level of symptoms and signs suggestive of renal impairment and potential for","Pt is ___ yo M with hx of of prior silent MI, HTN, HLD, transitional cell carcinoma (s/p radiation, no surgery or chemo) who p/w LLE edema and swelling . # DVT: Given the patient's history of bladder cancer and radiation within the past year, his LLE edema was most consistent on presentation with lymphatic obstruction, either from reseeding of the lymphatic bed with tumor or direct damage from radiation. However, the patient's pain on hip flexion, tenderness in the left hip, and acute onset suggested DVT. LENIs were negative, suggesting a more proximal DVT. He was started on a heparin drip on admission. CT abd/pelvis the following day demonstrated a 2cm DVT in the left external iliac vein. The patient's heparin drip was continued, and he was started on 5mg coumadin. His INR remained subtherapeutic, and his coumadin was increased to 10mg. The patient initially refused to go home on Lovenox injections on account of his fear of needles but after several attempts at counseling, he agreed to administer his own Lovenox with the assistance of a home ___ until his INR became therapeutic. He was discharged with 110mg BID Lovenox injections, 10mg coumadin qdaily, and scheduled to follow-up with his PCP to manage his anticoagulation over the next 6 months. He should follow-up with oncology or his PCP regarding how long to continue on anticoagulation given that inciting cause of DVT was either malignancy or XRT and it is unclear whether the provoking agent can ever be considered removed. . # Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline Cr is 1.2 and was 1.3 on admission. Per the patient, he has been dehydrated the previous 2 days. His Cr remained at baseline after adequate IVF rehydration and was 1.2 upon discharge. . # Bladder CA - In-house CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence or metastatic spread of patient's previous bladder cancer. The patient was scheduled for routine surveillance CT in ___, and we have communicated with his radiation oncologist in order to cancel this study, if the in-house CT performed during this hospitalization is sufficient to rule out recurrence. . # HTN - The patient's blood pressure was well-controlled throughout his hospitalization on his home anti-hypertensives. . # Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on his home statin. . # S/p silent MI - Given the patient's history of silent MI, we have communicated with the patient's PCP regarding aspirin and ACE inhibitor therapy. He will follow-up with his PCP for further management of this condition. . ","user

Suboptimal evaluation of the lung parenchyma due to respiratory motion artifact, there is complete collapsibility of bronchus intermedius and near-complete collapse of bilateral upper lobe bronchi. 2. 38% decrease of tracheal area at the sternal notch and 62% decrease at approximately 2 cm above the carina. Persistent severe bronchomalacia with mainstem bronchi measuring less than 3 mm with near-complete collapse on expiration. However, as noted above, respiratory motion results in incomplete analysis of inspiratory and expiratory measurements. 3.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization. Briefly, you were hospitalized with the flu. You were treated for the flu and for an exacerbation of your COPD. You were given steroids and your breathing improved. You will require a stay in rehab at ___ to help with your breathing and improve your strength. We wish you the best, Your ___ Treatment Team Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. ","Patient presents with worsening shortness of breath, new onset of rhonchous, and productive cough despite a recent medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The current presentation suggests a possible exacerbation of COPD with potential progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to vasculature and possibly acute left heart failure given the acute hypoxemia, low oxygen saturation (SpO2 = 39%). The acute symptoms could be due to postoperative effects following thoracic surgery or systemic infections like COVID-19, especially considering the high level of neutrophils, low LDH, and slightly decreased leukocyte count (5.7/12). There's also a suggestive trend towards coagulopathy evidenced by thrombocytopenia and decreased platelet count (3.42/L). 

Given these points, management would need to address both the respiratory concerns and any complications associated with cardiac and coagulation issues. These might involve intravenous fluids, vasopressors if necessary, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy based on cultures, close monitoring of vital signs, and addressing the suspected infection. Given the clinical context, the patient is stable, but urgent action should still be taken to prevent further deterioration.

### **Treatment Plan:**

- Monitor vital signs closely.
- Administer oxygen via nasal cannula as needed.
- Ensure adequate hydration.
- Consider administering vasopressors according to the patient's response.
- Obtain a full blood count to assess","___ with hx of COPD, ESRD s/p renal transplant, CAD p/w dyspnea and ___ and a positive influenza B swab. Thought to be a COPD exacerbation due to influenza B infection in the context of immunosuppression, with some component of mild pulmonary edema. During her hospital stay, she also developed oral thrush with associated sore throat. She has now completed treatment for influenza B and her respiratory status is stable. Her oral thrush and sore throat have resolved. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - Please draw tacrolimus trough level and Chem 10 on ___.

She was soon transitioned to room air after receiving prednisone and duonebs. Over the course of her hospital stay,she received a 5-day course of Tamiflu and 5-day course of prednisone 40 to treat her influenza B and COPD exacerbation. She began on duonebs q4h, which were weaned to ipratropium nebs q6h and albuterol nebs PRN. She continued to receive her home Advair. When she continued to have some dyspnea and wheezing with occasional oxygen requirement after receiving this treatment, we re-started predisone 60 with a planned wean of 60 x3 days, 40 x3 days, 20 x3 days, 10 x3 days, and 5 x3 days. We also performed a CT chest, which showed significant retained mucus in the lungs and potential aspiration. We started chest ___, humidified air and standing guanfesin. Her respiratory status is now stable, requiring albuterol nebs a few times a day in addition to her home medications. # CHF with reduced EF: EF 45% per ___ echo. No visible JVD or peripheral edema.
