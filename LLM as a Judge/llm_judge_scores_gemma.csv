### **Generated Summary:**  
The patient presents with symptoms of interstitial lung disease (ILD) secondary to lupus pneumonitis, which has been ongoing since 2004. The patient reports mild respiratory issues, including back and joint pain when breathing deeply, but no significant coughing episodes. There are no fever, chills, or production of sputum. These symptoms suggest an inflammatory process affecting the lungs, consistent with ILD. Further evaluation may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition. A chest X-ray would be appropriate to rule out other causes of respiratory distress. Given the patient's history of lupus pneumonitis, it is essential to monitor for potential complications such as pulmonary fibrosis or pleurisy. Regular monitoring of lung function tests and serial blood work may also be necessary to track changes in the patient's condition over time.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Diagnosis:** Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) secondary to Lupus Pneumonitis.

Um yeah, I was just having it uh, feeling the pain a bit more at the end of work. OK, does uh anything make it better or worse, the pain? Um yeah, if I, really if I'm just resting the elbow um it makes it better, and I've tried uh things like ibuprofen um which has helped with the pain, I'll I'll do that for um hoping I can get through work sometimes if the pain is bad enough.

No, it looks, it looks the same. Looks the same, OK so no um skin changes or deformities there? Uh no. No, OK, alright and now I'm going to get you to um just palpate uh that lateral or yeah, the lateral aspect of that elbow and you let me know if you feel pain when you push, push on that. Uh there is pain at the lateral uh lateral elbow. How about the medial aspect? No pain. No pain, OK, and how about when you palpate your um forearm and your biceps? Uh no no pain. OK, alright and then do you feel like it's hot, that area? No. No, OK now I am going to get you to um extend your wrist. OK. And then keep your elbow in full extension as well. Does that hurt? Uh it does, yeah. Yeah, OK, how about when you flex your wrist with the elbow still in full extension? Uh it does, yeah that hurts as well. OK, how about when you flex your elbow? Uh no, that that doesn't cause any pain. OK. How about when you extend your shoulder all the way up? No, nothing there, that feels fine. OK, and then flexing your uh, or sorry abducting your shoulder? That feels normal. OK, alright, and then how about when you pronate and supinate your forearms? Uh, pronation um? So like twist your um arm inwards so that your palm is facing the floor. No, that doesn't really cause any pain, pronation and supination. OK, alright. Um alright, and then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions? Um I'm uh healthy. You're healthy, OK. And then UM do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? I had a surgery for um a C-section for uh my, my son, um but that's that's it. OK. OK, and um how long ago was that? That was about uh 17 years ago. OK. And was that an emergency C-section? Uh no, it was not. OK um and then are you on any medications? Um no, I've just been taking uh Tylenol and Advil um for the pain. OK, alright um immunizations wise, are you up to date? Uh I I am, yes. OK. Do you have any allergies? Uh no allergies. OK, family history of any uh skeletal or muscular um issues? Um no, nothing like that in the family. OK, neurological issues in the family? Um no neurological issues in the family.

OK. Any recent travel? Uh nope, I've been at home. OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you. Yeah, no worries.","Subjective:

### **Generated Summary:**  
The patient presents with chronic pain on the outer aspect of their right elbow, described as achy and sharp, particularly after activities involving wrist movement and heavy lifting. The pain worsens with specific movements such as bending the wrist downward and picking up heavy objects. The pain is rated 4 out of 10 in severity. The patient reports no previous episodes of similar pain and denies any underlying medical conditions or recent hospitalizations. They are currently taking Tylenol and Advil for pain management. The physical examination reveals tenderness at the lateral aspect of the elbow upon palpation, with pain exacerbated by wrist extension and flexion. The patient's overall health appears to be generally healthy, with no significant medical history or current medication regimen. The presence of a history of a C-section without complications suggests that the pain may be related to the original surgical procedure rather than a new condition. Further evaluation and imaging studies are recommended to rule out any underlying causes of the pain.",,,,

"How may I help you? I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder. OK and when, when did this pain start? It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week. OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either. OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away. I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week. OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back? It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder. OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key? It's more achy. OK. But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp. OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse? Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts. OK, and have you done anything that's made it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder. OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then. Yeah. OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10. Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now. OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder? Mmmm OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder? Um no not that I know of. OK, have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK, have you had any skin rashes or or skin changes? No. OK so even over the area you haven't noticed any redness or like soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK, how about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK, have you had pains and any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK And. Um, Have you had any recent infections or or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting? Um nope. OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side. OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night? Yup. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm? Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell. OK, And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back? It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up. OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased? Mmm OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling? No, I haven't felt any of that. OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea? Nope, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? Nope. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago. OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK, do you take any medications regularly? Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it. OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with, and whereabouts? Yeah, so I'm living with with my wife in a small condominium in downtown. OK, and are you working currently? Yeah, I'm working as a real estate agent. OK, uh, and do you drink alcohol? Rarely just on some occasions, but not regularly. No. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis? No, I've never smoked. Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past? Nope OK. Um. And so so the next part, just for the physical exam. So do you have pain with shoulder AB duction. Uhm yes. So just to yeah, I do have some pain. Especially from. Yeah yeah pain throughout AB duction. OK, is there any like pain that's like parts of that that range of motion that are more painful for you? yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees is more painful. OK. And. If your arm is outstretched and your thumb pointing down so your arm is internally rotated does that give you pain? Yeah, if yeah, not not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it it the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain. OK. OK, so it sounds like a positive jobes test and a positive Neer's test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation? Uh. Just to, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder there is some some pain over with palpation. OK, that sensation is normal, reflexes are normal and strength is slightly reduced as well. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I maybe forgot? No, I think that's it. OK, um so based onI know that the symptoms today along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having a rotator cuff tear or um a rotator cuff impingement syndrome and where there is inflammation there not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So, uh, those would be the two most likely things. Yeah, their rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we were going to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging such as an X Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder. OK, sounds good. Thank you.","Subjective:

So 2 weeks, and can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain? Um yeah, I'm I'm just feeling this chest discomfort, sort of over on the left side. The left side, OK.

OK, does it feel dull and achy, or does it feel more sharp? It feels pretty sharp. OK, and is it constant like on all the time, or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes? It comes and goes. I would say I it might last for um 20-30 minutes at a time and then it goes away. OK, and over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worse? Uh, no. It's been about the same. About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes? No, it's happened about two or three times during the 2 weeks.

Uh, can you think of anything that that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain? Um, I don't know I've separated from my husband 2 two years ago which has been really stressful but other than that I mean I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently. OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general? Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life. OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away? Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped. OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes? Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving. OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before? No, I haven't had anything like this happen before. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? No, previously healthy.

Uhm, I do not, no medications, just the Tylenol and Advil I tried for the pain. OK, do you have any allergies? No allergies. And is there any history of heart problems in your family? Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year and it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I thought I was having. For sure, it always feels very concerning when when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had issues like similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations, that's a really tough thing to do so, good for you. That's that's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol? Um, I do, but, uh, I'll have maybe one or two glasses of wine on the weekend. Do you use any other substances? Uh no. I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specific things like have you ever been told you have high blood pressure? No, I've never been told I've I've had high blood pressure. And have you ever been told you have like high cholesterol? I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either. OK, and do you exercise regularly? Yeah, actually, I'll either do some running or cycling, probably three or four days per week and I haven't had any chest pain or or problems exercising. OK, that's good to hear. And have you ever had problems with heartburn? Uh. I don't think so, no. OK. OK, so just to kind of summarize what we've talked about, over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain that's on the left side, it feels more sharp, is that correct? Yeah. And it's kind of constant when it comes on, there's nothing really that makes it better or worse, it just kind of goes away on its own after half an hour or so, it has kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks, hasn't really gotten worse or better, it hasn't gone away either? Right, yeah exactly. You never had anything like that before and you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life, it definitely can play into that as well. OK, is there anything else that you wanted to to tell me about that I didn't ask you today? Uh, no, I think that's um, yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today. OK, so what I'm going to do is bring all this information to your family doctor and we can come back together and talk to you about the next steps. Awesome, thank you.

I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations, that's a really tough thing to do so, good for you. That's that's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol? Um, I do, but, uh, I'll have maybe one or two glasses of wine on the weekend. Do you use any other substances? Uh no. I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specific things like have you ever been told you have high blood pressure? No, I've never been told I've I've had high blood pressure. And have you ever been told you have like high cholesterol? I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either. OK, and do you exercise regularly? Yeah,
