Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4.

You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly.

No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear ___ ___ were admitted to the hospital after a completion colectomy for surgical management of your colon cancer. ___ have recovered from this procedure well and ___ are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. ___ will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact ___ regarding these results they will contact ___ before this time. ___ have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. ___ may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If ___ have steri-strips (small white strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming until cleared by the surgical team. Pain: It is expected that ___ will have pain after surgery and this pain will gradually improve over the first week or so ___ are home. ___ will especially have pain when changing positions and with movement. ___ should continue to take 2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. ___ may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days, please take Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your pain to a point where ___ can ambulate and perform minor tasks, ___ should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a car if taking narcotic pain medications. Activity ___ may feel weak or ""washed out"" for up to 6 weeks after surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks. At your first follow up appointment, your surgical team will clear ___ for heavier exercise and activity as they observe your progress. In the meantime, ___ may climb stairs, and go outside and walk. Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, drink liquids with electrolytes such as Gatorade. Please monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, dizziness especially when ___ stand, cramps in your abdomen or legs, increased thirst, or weakness. If ___ notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a regular diet with your new ileostomy. However, it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to ___ by the ostomy nurses. ___ monitor the appearance of your stoma and care for it as instructed by the ostomy nurses. ___ stoma should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched but this will improve over time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen. Our hope is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care!

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a ""huge"" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___.

On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a ""huge"" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___.

At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much. She denies cough or sputum production, and has no rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, sore throat, arthralgias/myalgias, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity edema. She does not 2 pillow orthopnea, but states this is not new. She has no known sick contacts or recent travel. Of note, her COPD medications have recently been changed around. She was previously taking Spiriva (tiotropium) and Advair (fluticasone-salmeterol) and was changed 2 weeks ago to Tudorza Pressair (aclinidium) and Dulera (mometasone-formoterol); however she states her insurance would not cover Tudorza, and so while she has been taking an ___ (Dulera) she has been without an inhaled anticholinergic. She also stopped taking daily prednisone 5mg PO 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of her pulmonologist. She was brought in by ambulance to the ___ ED.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement.

The patient explains she was in her usual state of health one day prior to admission, and enjoyed a ""long"" swim on ___. Following her swim she recalls napping for two hours and awakening feeling well. However, she thereafter noted the gradual onset of ""discomfort"" limited to the ""skull"" behind her right ear. She describes the discomfort as ""dull"" and rating ___ on a 10-point pain scale at its worst. She denies radiation of the discomfort. She denies identifiable triggers and exacerbating factors. She denies associated symptoms including phono- and photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck discomfort, changes in vision, and ear discomfort. She did not treat the HA or mention alleviating factors. She recalls going to bed as usual and falling to sleep without difficulty. She indicates her headache must have ""disappeared"" in the course of her sleep because she awakened feeling her usual self at a customary time between ___. The pt describes enjoying a ""lazy"" holiday morning. She recalls preparing breakfast while standing upright between 10: 30 and 11am. At that time, she describes ""stretching"" by fully extending her neck. In the midst of the maneuver, she states she developed an acute sense of ""severe sea-sickness,"" requiring her to hold on to the nearby oven for support. She says she had diarrhea within about three minutes of the symptom, and had to crawl to the bathroom because attempts to walk resulted in the persistent feeling that she would fall to the right. Other associated symptoms included nausea, although the pt denies vomiting. Following the episode of diarrhea, she assumed a supine position. She says that lying still ""with no movement"" seemed to decrease the intensity of the feeling of sea-sickness. She denies similar episodes in the past. The sx prompted her to call her PCP, who recommended she go to the ED for evaluation. The pt initially presented to the ___ by ambulance. The pt recalls the persistence of sea-sickness and nausea for about ___ hours until she was given an IV (which she thinks provided NS). This examiner could not elucidate from the available notes what treatment was given. The pt recalls a transient (~30 minute episode) of ""blurred vision"" while at ___ which she said spontaneously resolved. Notes suggest that the physicians at the OSH noted ""faint fatiguing nystagmus to the right"" and inferior visual field cuts. Reportedly, the laboratory studies, EKG, and CT performed at the outside hospital were normal or negative. She was subsequently transferred to the ___ for evaluation. En route by ambulance, the pt developed a headache in the occipital regions bilaterally. She recalls a gradual onset of non-radiating discomfort that rated ___ at its worst; she could not define the time from onset to peak discomfort. Since that time, she notes that the headache has moved to the temporal regions bilaterally and is much improved; she rates the discomfort as ___. She attributes the discomfort to ""not eating"" all day. At the time of evaluation, the pt reports feeling herself. She denies a sense of sea-sickness and nausea. She indicates her vision has completely normalized. Although she continues to experience slight bi-temporal ""dull"" discomfort, she indicates the sx is unlike her prior migraines. She denies any migraines for the ___ yrs PTA. On neurological review of systems, the pt specifically denies experiencing the ""room spinning around"" her and the sense that she might lose consciousness. Rather, she volunteers having felt as though she ""might fall"" from lack of balance. She denies neck pain. Of note, the pt recalls recent redecoration activities and describes herself as a ___. While she does recall assuming a position in which she extended her neck to paint the ceiling, she notes in was a ""long time ago."" She does note a ~1month hx of second-long episodes of left ___ discomfort. She indicates it feels as though she is ""punched in the eye."" She recalls 1 episode every ___ days. She denies associated tearing, congestion, and HA; the sx spontaneously resolves. General review of systems is positive for an URI in the 2 weeks prior to admission that included ""sinus sx,"" maximum temperature of ___ F, and sore throat. She denies associated ear discomfort and hearing difficulty. She treated the URI with ""homeopathic"" remedies and states she was feeling better by one week PTA.

Heart remains moderately enlarged. While there is no frank edema, the hila appear slightly congested. Tiny pleural effusions are suspected. No convincing evidence for pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour is stable. Bony structures are intact. IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly with mild hilar congestion. Tiny pleural effusions. ECHO ___: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation (inferior free wall is frankly akinetic) (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to global contractile dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, dyssynchrony. A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transthoracic study with transpulmonic microbubble contrast is recommended to better define the endocardium of the left ventricle. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, left ventricular contractile function is now severely impaired. B/l ___ VENOUS ULTRASOUND ___: FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the bilateral common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst.

This was due to a condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up into your lungs. The cause of this is still unclear. Many tests were sent but did not show a clear cause. You were given a diuretic medication through the IV to help get the fluid out. You were also found to have a blood clot in your heart. This was treated with blood thinners. You will continue injections of enoxaparin (Lovenox) until your warfarin (Coumadin) levels come up. When you were ready to leave the hospital, you were set up with a device to monitor your heart. You will follow up closely with our heart failure specialists to continue to manage this issue. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below) - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Weigh yourself every morning, seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night. It was a pleasure participating in your care.

Currently, the patient is feeling well. He has no headache or vision changes. No chest pain or palpitations. No dyspnea. No n/v/d. No fevers/chills. ROS: 10 point review of systems discussed with patient and negative unless noted above <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (PER OMR): ___ has a history of recurrent AML following his matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in ___. He remains in remission since his DLI with development of extensive sclerodermic GVHD. His severe sclerodermatous GVHD is complicated by multiple lower extremity skin infections requiring debridements and prior admissions for wound care and antibiotics. He has been on amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin for presumed skin colonization as directed by Dr. ___ ___; this was changed based on other antibiotics needs. His GVHD has progressed after receiving various immunesuppressant agents. He was started on ruxolitinib, the Jak 2 inhibitor for his GVHD on ___ as part of Protocol ___: Single patient IND of Ruxolitinib in a single patient, MA, with steroid refractory cGVHD. His dose has been adjusted over time, currently 15 mg following his HD, three times per week. He remains on Prednisone 10mg daily; Sirolimus has been discontinued. ___ other issues have been related to increasing shortness of breath requiring repeated admissions as outlined below. This has been in the setting of infections at times, but evaluation by Pulmonary has also shown worsening severe restrictive and obstructive lung disease, consistent with worsening GVHD of the lungs; this is related to sclerodermic GVHD of the chest wall causing restriction, plus possible bronchiolitis obliterans causing obstruction in the lung itself. He also has been noted for sCHF with reduced EF which contributes to his dyspnea, particularly in the setting of increased fluids. He has been followed by Dr. ___. He was on Torsemide for diuresis but often required IV Lasix when inpatient. ___ required a prolonged admission from ___ - ___ with initial issues of increasing cough, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. He was treated for acute on chronic mixed respiratory failure due to CHF exacerbation and pneumonia, acute renal failure, now with HD dependence on MWF hemodialysis schedule, and MRSA bacteremia (grown from port and HD line). Completed a 4-week course daptomycin with dapto locks. The HD line was ultimately replaced due to dehiscence of the tunneling. He developed an acute episode of respiratory distress requiring MICU admission; he was initiated on BiPAP with improvement in respiratory status, and he continues on this as an outpatient, using at night for the most part and during his dialysis. His renal failure was felt to be multi-factorial in the setting of aggressive diuresis for CHF and later with severe infection and sepsis. This was complicated by uremia/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has not needed further diuretics since starting on HD and his most recent echo on ___ with LVEF of 45-50%. His breathing has been better overall with the dialysis but remains tenuous. He has continued on Pulmicort two puffs twice per day, azithromycin and montelukast. Recent PFT's showed a decrease further in his DLCO with stable Chest CT. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: * AML -Diagnosed in ___ after having a sore throat, cough and fever.

The patient was last admitted from ___ for IVIG and scheduled HD which was tolerated well. In addition, the patient was previously treated with IV vancomycin for staph bacteremia. He completed this course on ___ and was transitioned to minocycline for suppression per ID. In addition, his ruxolitinib was increased from 15mg to 20mg after HD in addition to Vitamin E 100mg TIW. Currently, the patient is feeling well. He has no headache or vision changes. No chest pain or palpitations. No dyspnea. No n/v/d. No fevers/chills. ROS: 10 point review of systems discussed with patient and negative unless noted above <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (PER OMR): ___ has a history of recurrent AML following his matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in ___. He remains in remission since his DLI with development of extensive sclerodermic GVHD. His severe sclerodermatous GVHD is complicated by multiple lower extremity skin infections requiring debridements and prior admissions for wound care and antibiotics. He has been on amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin for presumed skin colonization as directed by Dr. ___ ___; this was changed based on other antibiotics needs. His GVHD has progressed after receiving various immunesuppressant agents. He was started on ruxolitinib, the Jak 2 inhibitor for his GVHD on ___ as part of Protocol ___: Single patient IND of Ruxolitinib in a single patient, MA, with steroid refractory cGVHD. His dose has been adjusted over time, currently 15 mg following his HD, three times per week. He remains on Prednisone 10mg daily; Sirolimus has been discontinued. ___ other issues have been related to increasing shortness of breath requiring repeated admissions as outlined below. This has been in the setting of infections at times, but evaluation by Pulmonary has also shown worsening severe restrictive and obstructive lung disease, consistent with worsening GVHD of the lungs; this is related to sclerodermic GVHD of the chest wall causing restriction, plus possible bronchiolitis obliterans causing obstruction in the lung itself. He also has been noted for sCHF with reduced EF which contributes to his dyspnea, particularly in the setting of increased fluids. He has been followed by Dr. ___. He was on Torsemide for diuresis but often required IV Lasix when inpatient. ___ required a prolonged admission from ___ - ___ with initial issues of increasing cough, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. He was treated for acute on chronic mixed respiratory failure due to CHF exacerbation and pneumonia, acute renal failure, now with HD dependence on MWF hemodialysis schedule, and MRSA bacteremia (grown from port and HD line). Completed a 4-week course daptomycin with dapto locks. The HD line was ultimately replaced due to dehiscence of the tunneling. He developed an acute episode of respiratory distress requiring MICU admission; he was initiated on BiPAP with improvement in respiratory status, and he continues on this as an outpatient, using at night for the most part and during his dialysis. His renal failure was felt to be multi-factorial in the setting of aggressive diuresis for CHF and later with severe infection and sepsis. This was complicated by uremia/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has not needed further diuretics since starting on HD and his most recent echo on ___ with LVEF of 45-50%. His breathing has been better overall with the dialysis but remains tenuous. He has continued on Pulmicort two puffs twice per day, azithromycin and montelukast. Recent PFT's showed a decrease further in his DLCO with stable Chest CT. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: * AML -Diagnosed in ___ after having a sore throat, cough and fever. Initially treated with ___ 7+3 regimen with a course complicated by fevers, sinusitis requiring multiple antibiotics, febrile neutropenia, s/p bronchoscopy (all cultures negative), C.Diff colitis, and retinal hemorrhage (from coughing). -Bone marrow biopsy on ___, without remission -Reinduction with MEC. Repeat bone marrow biopsy on day 14 after MEC did not show blasts. -MUD PSCT. Day ___: noted to have 10% peripheral blasts suggestive of clinical relapse; received chemotherapy and then DLI on ___, and remains in remission * Extensive chronic GVHD of skin, liver, mouth, eyes, lungs -Initial response to Prograf, but not prolonged -Started on Enbrel in ___, completed 5 weeks of therapy -Briefly on Gleevec without improvements -___, started on Sprycel, but developed bilateral pleural effusions in ___, so discontinued. -___, started low dose IL-2 SQ on DFCI protocol -Continued on CellCept at tapering doses and prednisone as well as Prograf ___ and discontinued ___, Treg DLI infusion with continued IL-2 injections. Overtime, felt he had received maximum benefit from IL-2 -Enrolled on Abatacept trial for steroid refractory cGVHD and received 1st dose on ___. Received total of 6 doses, last given on ___. Felt he did not have sustained response so taken off study. -Started Sirolimus, ___ with increasing dose based on levels, now 1.5 mg daily -___, started on ruxolitinib, the Jak 2 inhibitor for his GVHD as part of Protocol ___: Single patient IND of Ruxolitinib in a single patient, MA, with steroid refractory cGVHD. -___, Therapeutic Maggot wound therapy through ___, stopped due to increased pain; ___, restarted without issues.

For a full detailed history of the patient's lung cancer, please see ___ note from ___. In brief, most recently in ___, the patient had a CT chest which showed a 1.3 x 1.0 cm right lower lobe lung nodule, increased from 1.0 x 0.4 cm, thought to be most likely bronchogenic carcinoma. On ___ the patient had a CT guided RFA of this lesion. The procedure was complicated by a small amount of hemorrhage, and a small pneumothorax, so a biopsy of the lesion was not obtained. Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ from ___ to ___ with respiratory failure after the RFA. She was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia. Her oxygenation improved and she was discharged to ___ in ___, where she stayed for two weeks. A follow up CT with contrast on ___ showed a cavitary nodule in the medial RLL significantly increased to 3.4 x 3.7 cm compared with 2.3 cm with central low density suggesting necrosis. The nodule abutted the esophagus and posterior pericardium without definite evidence of invasion. Given the location of the patient's lesion, it was not felt to be amenable to a wedge resection, but would rather require a basal segmentectomy. However, it was also thought to be amenable to CyberKnife SBRT which would require biopsy and fiducial marker placement. On ___, she underwent outpatient biopsy & fiducial placement of RLL lung mass. 4 core biopsy samples were sent for pathology, and 10cc of purulent fluid were sent for microbiology. A CT showed a small paramediastinal pneumothorax post-procedure, with follow up CXRs at 2 and 4 hours post procedure showing resolution of the PTX. Clinically, she has been stable on room air. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports that her breathing is at baseline with no shortness of breath. She states that the procedure was quite painful, but that she no longer has any pain. She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or other complaints, and is hopeful that she will be able to go home early tomorrow. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Age-related macular degeneration - GERD - Hyperlipidemia - Prior removal of a vocal cord polyp - Hypertension - Lung cancer - Squamous cell cancer on the face - Left bundle branch block PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: - s/p squamous cell cancer removal from face - s/p vocal cord polyp removal <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> son died of met CA, daughter healthy Physical ___: ADMISSION EXAM: -== VITALS: 97.3PO148 / 79 HR: 70RR: 20O2: 96RA GENERAL: Alert and interactive.

After his last dialysis session (during which 1L was removed), the patient had 30 min of chest tightness. This was associated with shortness of breath, palpitations, and weakness that lasted 2 hours. He also endorsed lightheadedness when standing and blurry vision, which have since resolved. The patient came to the ED, where a pacemaker interrogation was performed by EP, demonstrating normal pacer function with 98.6% AS-VP. Troponin was 0.14 and MB was 5. Cardiology recommended admission, but the patient left AMA to take his daughter to an appointment. He returned shortly thereafter and agreed to be admitted. The patient also has a chronic non-healing left great toe wound that has been painful for the past 10 months and has become more swollen and productive of yellow discharge over the past week. He was evaluated by podiatry and planned for a partial amputation. In the ED, initial VS were 98.2 78 128/69 15 97RA.

You were taken to the operating room where you had a ventral hernia repaired. During your post-operative course, you were noted to have an elevated white blood cell count and you were started on an antibiotic for a presumed pneumonia. Your skin around the incision site also developed some redness, which can be a sign of infection. The antibiotic you are on will likely be able to cover for any possible skin infection - we are giving you a prescription for a 10-day course. Your vital signs have been stable and your white blood cell count has normalized. You are now preparing for discharge home with the following instructions: Medications: Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take any new medications as prescribed. These will include: *Clindamycin 450 mg by mouth daily, for 8 days *Oxycodone 4 mg by mouth every four hours, as needed for pain *Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily, while taking oxycodone Activity: -Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid lifting weights greater than ___ lbs until you follow-up with your surgeon, who will instruct you further regarding activity restrictions. -Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain medications. -Please follow-up with your surgeon and Primary Care Provider (PCP) as advised. Incision Care: -Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site. -Avoid swimming and baths until your follow-up appointment. -You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water. Gently pat the area dry. -If you have staples, they will be removed at your follow-up appointment. -If you have steri-strips, they will fall off on their own. Please remove any remaining strips ___ days after surgery. Pain control: -You were given oxycodone, an opioid pain medication. This may cause constipation so you should increase your fiber intake and take colace twice daily to prevent this. -Only take your pain medication when you need to. -Do not drive after taking oxycodone.

You have recuperated well and you are now ready to head home. Please follow this instructions in order to continue your recovery * Your injury caused 1 rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain. Please use your IS machine every 10 minutes in order to continue improving your breathing. * You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician. * Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs. * You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing. * Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain. * Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. * Do NOT smoke * If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves. * Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs (crepitus).

RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield. CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 26% of total analyzed events. B cells comprise 14% of lymphoid gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express aberrant antigens. T cells comprise 64% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens CD3, CD5, CD2, CD7. T cells have a normal helper cytotoxic ratio of 3: 1 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0). Cell marker analysis demonstrates a mildly increased percentage of natural killer cells at 20% (usual range in blood ___. INTERPRETATION Nonspecific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical findings is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, sampling, or artifacts of sample preparation. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

After consulting the infectious disease and hematology specialists, we think that the most likely cause of your neutropenia is due to a medication effect. We have stopped Bactrim and are putting you on a different medication, atovaquone. We also decreased your mycophenolate dose to 750mg twice a day, because it too can cause neutropenia. Your counts recovered without any complications. We also had the endocrine specialists to come see you. They thought that you should be adequately treated for hypothyroidism on 75mcg of levothyroxine daily, which we will continue until you follow up with Dr. ___. Please weigh yourself every morning, and call Dr. ___ your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Also, take your medications as directed and keep all of your appointments. It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the ___!

You should continue to walk several times a day. - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as tolerated. - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common sense and go slowly at first. - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. - Continue to wear your abdominal binder. - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you otherwise. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: - You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during the surgery. YOUR BOWELS: - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. PAIN MANAGEMENT: - You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean off these medications as tolerated. - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. If you experience any of the following, please contact your surgeon: - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever - shaking chills, fever of more than 101 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or your medications - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing) -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you Additional: - pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest or back - urinary: burning or blood in your urine or the inability to urinate MEDICATIONS: - Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently. - If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to take, please call your surgeon. WOUND CARE: -You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off. -Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery unless told otherwise by your surgical team. -Notify your surgeon if you notice abnormal (foul smelling, bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a quick return to your usual life and activities. DRAIN CARE: You are being discharged with a drain in place.

Mitral valve replacement with ___ On-X mechanical valve. ___: Temporary screw in pacemaker placed via right IJ using ultrasound guidance. <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He presented from an outside hospital with strep viridans bacteremia likely related to a periodontal infection in ___. He reportedly he pulled his own tooth out. He subsequently developed progressive back and left hip pain along with fatigue, weight loss, and malaise. He was seen by his PCP as an outpatient and underwent MRI of lumbar spine which showed evidence of discitis vs osteomyelitis, prompting presentation to ___ on ___. His hospital course was further complicated by lumbar osteomyelitis, multifocal PNA, bilateral PEs and emphysema seen on CTA, as well as aortic and mitral endocarditis. In addition to aortic and mitral vegetations, TTE/TEE at the outside hospital showed severe aortic regurgitation with an abscess in the mitral-aortic continuity and involvement of the anterior mitral leaflet. He is on Penicillin G, heparin gtt for PE's (HIT neg) and hemodynamically stable at present. We are consulted for consideration of valve reconstruction. Of note MRI was notable for diffuse abnormal bone marrow signal, consistent with a marrow replacement process, also with anemia at OSH requiring 2 units PRBC, along with splenomegaly found on imaging. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> Endocarditis, Strep Viridans Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Smoker, current Surgical History: s/p rotator cuff repair, s/p hernia repair, s/p L knee repair, s/p jaw repair <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Mother and father with heart disease <PHYSICAL EXAM> PREOPERATIVE EXAM: Pulse: 84 Resp: 2 0 O2 sat: 98 B/P Right: 143/48 Left: Height: 6'1"" Weight: 76 kg General: NAD Skin: Dry [x] intact [x] HEENT: PERRLA [x] EOMI [x] Neck: Supple [x] Full ROM [x] Chest: Lungs clear bilaterally [x] Heart: RRR [x] Irregular [] Murmur [x] grade ______ Abdomen: Soft [x] non-distended [x] non-tender [x] bowel sounds + [x] Extremities: Warm [x], well-perfused [x] Edema [] _____ Varicosities: None [x] Neuro: Grossly intact [x] Pulses: Femoral Right: Left: DP Right: p Left: p ___ Right: p Left: p Radial Right: p Left: p Carotid Bruit: Right: - Left: - DISCHARGE EXAM: Vital Signs Temp: 98.2, BP: 113/72, HR: 74, RR: 18, O2 sat: 98%, O2 delivery: RA, Wt: 157.63 lb Pre-op 167.5 lbs Physical Examination: General: NAD [x] Neurological: A/O x3 [x] non-focal [x] HEENT: PEERL [x] Cardiovascular: RRR [x] mech valve click [x] Respiratory: CTA [x] Decreased at bases No resp distress [x] GI/Abdomen: Bowel sounds present [x] Soft [x] ND [x] NT [x] Extremities: Right Upper extremity Warm [x] Edema neg Left Upper extremity Warm [x] Edema neg Right Lower extremity Warm [x] Edema neg Left Lower extremity Warm [x] Edema neg Pulses: DP Right: 1 Left: 1 ___ Right: 1 Left: 1 Radial Right: 1 Left: 1 Skin/Wounds: Dry [x] intact [x] Sternal: CDI [x] no erythema or drainage [x] Sternum stable [x] Other: R PICC c/d/I <PERTINENT RESULTS> STUDIES: Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___ The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a mildly increased/dilated cavity. There is normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 52 % (normal 54-73%). Due to severity of aortic regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely lower. Left ventricular cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a mildly dilated descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. No mass/vegetation seen, but cannot fully exclude due to suboptimal image quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The increased velocity is due to aortic regurgitation/stroke volume. There is an eccentric, interventricular septum directed jet of moderate to severe [3+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. A LARGE (2.4 cm) echodensity is seen on the left atrial side of the mitral valve with central lucency most c/w a vegetation with abscess. A LARGE ABSCESS is present. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.","{'PROBLEM': ['/ wounds', '_', '_ _ _ _ _ mass', 'a cystic component', 'a large ( 2. 4 cm ) echodensity', 'a large abscess', 'a large mass', 'a mildly dilated descending aorta', 'a mildly dilated descendingrta', 'a mildly increased / dilated cavity', 'a periodontal infection', 'a right pleural effusion', 'a small secundum type atrial septal defect', 'a vegetation', 'abnormal valve', 'abscess', 'acoustic shadowing', 'allergies', 'an eccentric, interventricular septum directed jet of', 'anemia', 'any vegetations', 'aortic and mitral endocarditis', 'aortic regurgitation', 'aortic regurgitationlet', 'aortic valve stenosis', 'apical aneurysm', 'atrial volume index', 'bactrim', 'bilateral pes', 'biventicular hypokinesis', 'bone / joint infections', 'borderline elevated', 'central lucency', 'change in regurgitation', 'change in systolic function', 'change in tricuspid valve morphology', 'contrast', 'discitis', 'discrete vegetation', 'dissection', 'distended', 'drainage edema', 'dry', 'edema ne', 'effusion', 'endocarditis', 'erythema', 'fatigue', 'hyperlipidemia', 'hypertension', 'infective endocarditis', 'irregular', 'large', 'large mitral valve echodensity', 'lic dysfunction', 'lumbar osteomyelitis', 'lv', 'mass', 'mild', 'mild [ 1 + ] mitral regurgitation', 'mild [ 1 + ] tricuspid regurgitation', 'mild [ 1 + ] valvular regurgitation', 'mild cavity dilation', 'mild global biventricular hypokinesis', 'mild global free wall hypokinesis', 'mild sinus dilation', 'mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy', 'mildly dilated', 'mildly enlarged', 'mildly thickened', 'mitral regurgitation', 'mitral regurgitationlm', 'mitral valve prolapse', 'moderate [ 2 + ] regurgitation', 'moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension', 'moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy', 'moderate to severe [ 3 + ] aortic regurgitation', 'moderate to severe aortic regurgitation', 'multifocal pna', 'multiple perforations of the amvl', 'murmur', 'nad', 'new hypokinesis of septal wall', 'non', 'osteomyelitis', 'pain', ""pe ' s"", 'pericardi', 'pericardial effusion', 'physiologic tricuspid regurgitation', 'pneumothorax', 'polymorphonuclear leukocytes', 'post -

We think you felt this way because you had too much salt in your diet at home and with your heart failure, you retained fluid. While at the hospital we gave your IV medicine to get the extra fluid off, and you are returning to home on your home medications. We did not change any of your home medications. Please weigh yourself daily in the morning after urinating on a good quality scale in light weight clothing. Call your cardiologist's office ___ if your weight goes up by more than 3lbs in one day or 5lbs in three days. We sent you home with extra torsemide pills. You can take an extra pill in the afternoon if you find your weight is increasing by a few pounds. If you have any questions, call your cardiology doctors office for advice. We wish you all the best!

Suboptimal evaluation of the lung parenchyma due to respiratory motion artifact, there is complete collapsibility of bronchus intermedius and near-complete collapse of bilateral upper lobe bronchi. 2. 38% decrease of tracheal area at the sternal notch and 62% decrease at approximately 2 cm above the carina. Persistent severe bronchomalacia with mainstem bronchi measuring less than 3 mm with near-complete collapse on expiration. However, as noted above, respiratory motion results in incomplete analysis of inspiratory and expiratory measurements. 3. Multiple new bilateral parenchymal opacities, with more confluent within the bilateral lower lobes, are concerning for aspiration with some element of mucoid impaction. 4. Stable subsolid lesion with ground-glass opacity and cystic foci, currently measuring 18 x 10 mm, previously 16 x 13 mm. Given the degree of respiratory motion artifact, these measurements are approximation. 5. Moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysema. 6. Persistent prominence of the main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 3.1 cm. Given patient's known background moderate to severe centrilobular emphysema, this is likely a sequela of pulmonary arterial hypertension. CXR ___ IMPRESSION: Decreased small pleural effusions.

Patient states that she was asleep overnight with her CPAP and abruptly woke up. She was not acutely short of breath, and was able to breath right away, but thought she possibly had an episode of apnea. She sat up, but was very sleepy so sat up but fell asleep again without her CPAP on. She later awoke again abruptly without dyspnea, again attributing it to apnea. She then slept for the rest of the night comfortably without CPAP until her CNA woke her up in the morning as per routine. Patient had plans for the day but decided to present to the ED for evaluation of her two abrupt awakenings overnight. Patient's CPAP does not have an apnea alarm. In further exploring her symptoms, patient reports she is (and has been in the recent few days) at her baseline ___ right sided chest pain and abdominal pain. She has an undulating course of shortness of breath also since ___, and although she has been on a mild upswing this week, she is not here for that complaint, as her breathing is still essentially within the worse limit of her baseline.

You were admitted because you had an episode of atrial fibrillation that triggered your ICD device. You also had a heart failure exacerbation and were treated with IV diuretics to decrease the fluid retention. You were then changed back to your regular oral diuretic dose. Your ICD showed that you are having recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. We recommend pulmonary vein isolation, a surgical procedure that can prevent new episodes of atrial fibrillation. This will be done as an outpatient. We have changed the dose of your home warfarin from 7.5mg to 4mg. The rest of your medications have not been modified. Please remember to take you medication as instructed and have a diet low in salt. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (___). LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. LVOT gradient increases with Valsalva. RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AS. Trace AR. MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve leaflets not well seen. TRICUSPID VALVE: Borderline PA systolic hypertension. PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position. Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There was no resting left ventricular outflow gradient, but the gradient increased to mild with the Valsalva manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal overall biventricular function. Left ventricle is unusually small and underfilled.

His residual deficits from his prior strokes include right leg weakness and dysphagia. He was however ambulatory and ate a regular diet, always taking great care to avoid aspiration. He presented to ___ on ___ with new left leg weakness, disequilibrium, blurry vision, slightly worsened dysphagia, and ""feeling lousy"". He had been started on Lopressor 12.5mg BID 4 days prior. He did not have lightheadedness or vertigo, but very specifically states he had difficulty coordinating his legs on the ground. He was admitted and slowly improved over the subsequent ___ days. ESR was elevated at 130 and he was given a dose of Solumedrol for potential temporal arteritis. On ___, after lunch he acutely felt worse with increased left leg weakness, blurry vision, and left basilar headache. Code stroke was called.

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: - High Cholesterol - Amyloid angiopathy - Coronary artery disease, Peripheral vascular disease We are changing your medications as follows: - START atorvastatin 80mg DAILY - HOLD pantoprazole for now. It clogs your PEG tube. You are receiving the IV version. - CONTINUE amlodipine 5mg DAILY. - CONTINUE aspirin 81mg DAILY. - CONTINUE clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg DAILY. Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician as listed below. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body Thank You, Your ___ Neurology Team ","<|begin_of_text|><SEX> M <SERVICE> NEUROLOGY <ALLERGIES> Penicillins <ATTENDING> ___ <CHIEF COMPLAINT> Left leg weakness, disequilibrium, blurry vision, worsened dysphagia, <MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURE> - PEG placement (___) - PEG tube replacement with larger tube (___) <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with a history of strokes (x3, last in ___), aortic stenosis s/p TAVR, CAD s/p stents x4, defibrillator, PAD/PVD.

I talked to her daughter today as ___ was then on route to the hospital via ambulance. She has initial history of very significant ___, had a THR ___ years ago and the acetabulum failed to ingrown went vertical. We modified her with a revision acetabulum. Two months ago, utilizing ___ Longevity and trilogy series trabecular metal 56 mm shell with standard liner. Unfortunately, she has had posterior dislocation three times and has been wearing an abductor brace repeatedly comes out in flexion and internal rotation despite the brace. She is very compliant and very thoughtful person and I have no doubt that she has been doing her best to stay within the compliance regulation. In any event, the soft tissues which were limited at the time of the surgery in terms of available residual capsule and piriformis now will be completely torn out, certainly. We in the emergency room were able to easily relocate her with propofol and she was put into a knee brace and the postoperative x-ray shows complete reduction. She does have some evidence of osteolysis posterior to the cup which we have seen on all of her films, I think it relates to the fact that she has a bit of bilobed shape in this 56 mm native acetabulum and we had to bone graft and behind it. Screw fixation appears intact. The femoral side has never been an issue. My concerns in addition to the recurrent dislocation are whether or not she might have an infection. LABORATORY DATA: Her lab work today, white blood count is good at 9.3. She does have shifted 85% neutrophils, but no bands. However, her ESR is a little bit elevated at 27, but she is only two months postop, this is actually the lowest ESR we have seen on her in the three times that has been measured in ___ years. Her CRP is 13.6 and certainly while elevated, it is significantly improved from the 42.0 it was this ___. She has been aspirated this ___ and was culture negative with a low intra-articular WBC count of only 225 back in ___ when we made preparations for revision THR. She has never had symptoms suggestive of infection. Her incision looks fine. However, we are admitting her tonight planning to operate on her in two days with the revision acetabulum. In the morning, we will get a fluoroscopic-guided aspiration of the hip not only for cultures, but also for cell count, differential will be important. We tentatively have her on this or scheduled for two or three days from now, but we will be most interested in seeing whether or not the culture or fluid results show marked abnormality. If so, then the possibility of resection arthroplasty stands. Whether or not we would have to hold off on surgery for a couple days to await final culture results is a possibility. For now, we will make plans towards getting the equipment in for revision THR and if we need to change our course accordingly, we will. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> HTN, asthma, h/o breast cancer, raynauds <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Sister also with ___ <PHYSICAL EXAM> Well appearing in no acute distress Afebrile with stable vital signs Pain well-controlled Respiratory: CTAB Cardiovascular: RRR Gastrointestinal: NT/ND Genitourinary: Voiding independently Neurologic: Intact with no focal deficits Psychiatric: Pleasant, A&O x3 Musculoskeletal Lower Extremity: * Incision healing well with staples * Scant serosanguinous drainage * Thigh full but soft * No calf tenderness * ___ strength ___ * SILT DP/SP/T/S/S * Toes warm <PERTINENT RESULTS> ___ 09: 23PM ___ PTT-31.3 ___ ___ 08: 37PM URINE COLOR-Straw APPEAR-Clear SP ___ ___ 08: 37PM URINE BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-NEG ___ 07: 58PM GLUCOSE-99 UREA N-17 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-12 ___ 07: 58PM estGFR-Using this ___ 07: 58PM CRP-13.6* ___ 07: 58PM WBC-9.3 RBC-4.43 HGB-12.3 HCT-36.7 MCV-83 MCH-27.8 MCHC-33.5 RDW-13.8 ___ 07: 58PM NEUTS-85.6* LYMPHS-11.1* MONOS-2.4 EOS-0.5 BASOS-0.4 ___ 07: 58PM PLT COUNT-453* ___ 07: 58PM SED RATE-27* <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> atenolol 50 mg QD, naprosyn prn, oxycodone prn, theophylline 200 mg BID, Cal/VitD, MVI <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).

Your management included conservative measures such as bowel rest and intravenous fluids, and serial abdominal exams. You did not require antibiotics. You did not require surgery for this condition. You were able to tolerate regular diet and fluids at the time of your discharge. Please follow instructions outlined below to ensure good recovery. ANTIBIOTICS: Please complete the full course of antibiotics as instructed. DO NOT stop taking antibiotics if your symptoms resolve before the end of the prescribed course. Take antibiotics with food to avoid nausea. ACTIVITY: You may resume regular activity. You may climb stairs. You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you otherwise. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You might feel somewhat depressed. You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem unappealing. All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go away in a short time. YOUR BOWELS: Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as oxycodone, Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your primary care doctor and the surgery office to schedule an appointment. Drink plenty of fluids. If you develop diarrhea, stop taking laxatives. If it does not go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. MEDICATIONS: Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently. If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to take, please call your surgeon.

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Triangular opacity within the posterior aspect of the right medial lung for which further assessment with contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended. ___ CTA CHEST IMPRESSION: 1. Right lower lobe pleural-based mass measuring up to 6.4 cm. Differential considerations include primary neoplasm, or less likely an infectious or inflammatory process. 2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 3. Bronchial wall thickening, consistent with small airways disease. ___ CT Abdomen/Pelvis w & w/o contrast IMPRESSION: Stable large mass lower right chest, may represent solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. There is a 0.6 cm indeterminate lesion left kidney, with central linear thin enhancement, follow-up retroperitoneal ultrasound, or MRI in 6 months recommended. There is 3.4 cm well-circumscribed left adnexal mass, may represent pedunculated fibroid versus ovarian neoplasm. Pelvic ultrasound recommended in further evaluation. ___ PELVIS U.S., TRANSVAGINAL IMPRESSION: 1. Normal ovaries. 2. Three fibroids are identified. The larger 2 fibroids correspond with structures visualized on the prior CT. Please note that on the ultrasound the questionable adnexal structure appears on the right side and on the prior CT of ___ this structure appears on the left side. The significance of this is uncertain. If further clinical evaluation is required a repeat ultrasound could be performed or if further delineation of the fibroid is needed an MRI could be performed. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation. 1.

You were admitted because you had chest pain. You were taken to the cath lab, where luckily they found no residual heart disease. You had an echocardiogram that also showed that your heart is pumping very well. We suggest continuing to take aspirin, propranolol and atorvastatin for now for heart protection. You were also found to have a heart rhythm called ""atrial fibrillation."" This condition is associated with a risk of strokes. Apixaban, and other blood thinners, can help decrease this risk substantially. Please continue to take your apixaban. Please follow up with your primary care doctor about the results of your pleural biopsy. They will determine from there with what specialty to follow up with for ongoing monitoring and care.

You were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the following instructions. Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the appointment listed below. ACTIVITY: o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and feel you could respond in an emergency. o You may climb stairs. o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. o Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap. o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you can resume tub baths or swimming. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: o You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during surgery. o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You might feel somewhat depressed. o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem unappealing. o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon. YOUR INCISION: o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay). o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is normal. o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision. o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area. o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told otherwise. o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call your surgeon. o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may resume tub baths or swimming. YOUR BOWELS: o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. PAIN MANAGEMENT: o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do not take it more frequently than prescribed.
