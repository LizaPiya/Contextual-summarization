On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___.
