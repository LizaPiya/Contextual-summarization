INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___.
