"Good afternoon, champ, how you holding up? Good afternoon, Doctor, I have a lot of lower back pain. Oh no, before we begin, how old are you, sir and which hand do you write with? I'm seventy five now. Right. Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain? It's been about ten days now. Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? No, they keep getting worse. Does the pain radiate into your legs? Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. Have you seen another doctor for this pain? Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. What kind of treatments did he recommend? He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. Did you drive yourself? Yes, I did. How did the antiinflammatories work? Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner. Was there any leg numbness? Yes. Since December eleventh. Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain. What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do? He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong. He recommended I follow up at U I H C. The imaging was on my L S Spine.","Subjective:

Um, other than uh, smoking cigarettes, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana at all? No. No. How about alcohol? Uh, I just drink on the weekends. Maybe a glass or two of wine. Okay, and uh yeah. So those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns? No. No? I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID. Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good. Great, I'm glad. Alright, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care.","Subjective:

"It sounds like that you're experiencing some chest pain. Yeah, so this chest pain has just been coming on for the last couple of weeks now. OK, uhm. So 2 weeks, and can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain? Um yeah, I'm I'm just feeling this chest discomfort, sort of over on the left side. The left side, OK. Does does it stay just in one spot or does it kind of spread anywhere else? No, I don't really feel it anywhere else. Yeah, I just feel it in that one spot on the left side. OK, does it feel dull and achy, or does it feel more sharp? It feels pretty sharp. OK, and is it constant like on all the time, or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes? It comes and goes. I would say I it might last for um 20-30 minutes at a time and then it goes away. OK, and over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worse? Uh, no. It's been about the same. About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes? No, it's happened about two or three times during the 2 weeks. And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst pain you've ever felt, where would it fall? I would say a 4 out of 10. OK. Uh, can you think of anything that that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain? Um, I don't know I've separated from my husband 2 two years ago which has been really stressful but other than that I mean I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently. OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general? Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life. OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away? Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped. OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes? Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving. OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before? No, I haven't had anything like this happen before. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? No, previously healthy. And just jumping back to these pain episodes when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any nausea or vomiting? No. OK, do you get any, do you have any difficulty breathing during these times? No, I haven't. OK, and have you noticed any fevers? Uh, no, no fevers. OK, have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick recently? Uhm, no, I haven't. And have you traveled anywhere outside of Canada? No, I've been home. OK so you have, you said you have been previously healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medications? Uhm, I do not, no medications, just the Tylenol and Advil I tried for the pain. OK, do you have any allergies? No allergies. And is there any history of heart problems in your family? Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year and it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I thought I was having. For sure, it always feels very concerning when when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had issues like similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations, that's a really tough thing to do so, good for you. That's that's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol? Um, I do, but, uh, I'll have maybe one or two glasses of wine on the weekend. Do you use any other substances? Uh no. I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specific things like have you ever been told you have high blood pressure? No, I've never been told I've I've had high blood pressure. And have you ever been told you have like high cholesterol? I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either. OK, and do you exercise regularly? Yeah, actually, I'll either do some running or cycling, probably three or four days per week and I haven't had any chest pain or or problems exercising. OK, that's good to hear. And have you ever had problems with heartburn? Uh. I don't think so, no. OK. OK, so just to kind of summarize what we've talked about, over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain that's on the left side, it feels more sharp, is that correct? Yeah. And it's kind of constant when it comes on, there's nothing really that makes it better or worse, it just kind of goes away on its own after half an hour or so, it has kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks, hasn't really gotten worse or better, it hasn't gone away either? Right, yeah exactly. You never had anything like that before and you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life, it definitely can play into that as well. OK, is there anything else that you wanted to to tell me about that I didn't ask you today? Uh, no, I think that's um, yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today. OK, so what I'm going to do is bring all this information to your family doctor and we can come back together and talk to you about the next steps. Awesome, thank you.

About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes? No, it's happened about two or three times during the 2 weeks. And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst pain you've ever felt, where would it fall? I would say a 4 out of 10. OK. Uh, can you think of anything that that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain? Um, I don't know I've separated from my husband 2 two years ago which has been really stressful but other than that I mean I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently. OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general? Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life. OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away? Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped. OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes? Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving. OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before? No, I haven't had anything like this happen before. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? No, previously healthy. And just jumping back to these pain episodes when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any nausea or vomiting? No. OK, do you get any, do you have any difficulty breathing during these times? No, I haven't. OK, and have you noticed any fevers? Uh, no, no fevers. OK, have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick recently? Uhm, no, I haven't. And have you traveled anywhere outside of Canada? No, I've been home. OK so you have, you said you have been previously healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medications? Uhm, I do not, no medications, just the Tylenol and Advil I tried for the pain. OK, do you have any allergies? No allergies. And is there any history of heart problems in your family? Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year and it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I thought I was having. For sure, it always feels very concerning when when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had issues like similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations, that's a really","[0.00801396369934082, 0.008009910583496094, 0.008005860261619091, 0.008003952912986279, 0.008000378496944904, 0.00799751840531826, 0.007997277192771435,

"What brings you in? Yeah, I'm just coming in with my son, he's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last I would say three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now. Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain? I would say four days now. Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss? Uh, no, he still responds when I call his name. OK and, have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears? Uh, no, I don't think so. Is it more like one side of his ears or is it both ears? It's just his right ear. Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm? Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all. OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears? Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much. OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start? Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain. OK. Any fevers? Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that. OK, any weight loss over the past month or so? No. No, any change in his hair or nails, like rashes or, sorry, or skin? Yeah, no, I haven't seen any changes in the skin. OK, any changes in his vision or smell or taste? No. No, OK. His runny nose, what color is it? It was mainly, uh, it seemed to me like it was mainly clear when it was happening, like he wasn't bringing up any yellow or green material. OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all? No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so. OK, that's good. Has he had a cough? Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on. OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough? Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday. Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm? No, it seems to be just dry. I think I just noticed it like three or four times during the day yesterday. OK, so no blood that he's bringing up right? No, no. OK, and does he have any shortness of breath? No, no. No, OK, any wheezing? No, no wheezing. No chest pain? No. OK, uhm, any nausea or vomiting? No nausea or vomiting. Any changes to his bowel movements? No. No, OK and, how about urine, is that normal? Yeah, Uh, no changes at all. Any headaches? Not that he's told me about. OK, dizziness or fainting spells? No. Feeling like he's off balance or lost coordination? No, I don't think so. No, OK, no numbness, no tingling? No. Has he had any contacts with sick people recently? Uhm, no, I don't think anyone's been sick around him. OK and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Uh, no, like, he's mainly just been inside his home. OK. has he ever had ear pain before? He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one. OK, was he prescribed any medications? Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time. OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time. No, I think that, only that one I can recall. OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy? Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that. No hospitalizations or surgeries? No. And is he on any medications? No medications. OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations? Yeah, all his immunizations are good. OK, any allergies? Not that we know of so far. And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions. No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all. OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac? Fairly young I would say, in his 20s. OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well. OK. Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner? Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog. OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house? We live in a, it's like a condominium. OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building? No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that? No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child. OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn? Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards. OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own? Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend? Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins, we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. OK yeah, no worries.","Subjective:

"What brings you in today? Yeah, so I've had this cough that started within the last day and uhm, I've also been particularly short of breath as well. OK. Can you tell me about the, the cough, how, is it dry cough or wet cough? It's wet, I've been bringing up, uh, sputum that's uh, It's just, it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth when bringing it up. What color is the sputum? It's kind of, uh, like, yellowish green, type color. Havey you noticed any blood? No, I haven't seen any blood. And it only started yesterday. What about the difficulties breathing, when did that start? Yeah, that started really within the last twelve hours or so. And can you tell me if it's gotten better or worse since then? Yeah, it's been, it's been getting worse, uhm, and the phlegm, also smells really bad. OK. When do you have difficult, like, is there anything that makes the, shortness of breath, worse? Yeah, if I, uhm, when I was having a cigarette earlier today, it got a bit worse and when I went out to get the Mail today I, I just couldn't do it. I, I had to just sit down. And that what happened to you before, right? OK. Uh, and say two days ago, were you feeling perfectly fine? I was yeah, I wasn't sick at all. OK, so you've had this bad cough and you've had some difficulties breathing since yesterday. Have you had a headache at all? No, no headache. Any, uh, runny nose? No, it's really, no. Any congestion? No. No, OK. Have you had any pain in your chest? Uh, no pain. When you're breathing in or breathing out any pain at that time? or deep breathing? No, I haven't had any pain. OK, have you had any palpitations or you feel like your heart's racing? Uh, yeah, I do. I feel like my heart has been beating a little bit faster. OK. And any pain in your belly? No. Nausea or vomiting? Uh no, but, well I guess I have felt a little nauseous with the, uhm, bad taste in my mouth. OK, and any uh diarrhea or Constipation? Uhm no, I haven't anything like that. OK, any sore throat? Uhm, no. OK alright uhm, any other symptoms that I haven't talked about, that you experienced over the past day? No, it's really been, uhm, yeah, this cough and bringing up this, this sputum and being short of breath. OK, uhm, can you tell me about your past uh, medical history, do you have any medical conditions? Uh yeah, I have uhm, high blood pressure. Mhm. I also have acid reflux, so uh, gerd I think, think it's called? Yeah. And, uhm, high cholesterol as well. OK, ok. And I've also been, had issues with anxiety in the past as well. In terms of medications, are you taking any? Yeah, I take uhm, an ACE inhibitor, statin, uhm, and uh, medication for my stomach, I think, like Pantoprazole. OK, and uh, how well has your gerd been controlled? Uh, it kind of, it bugs me most days, its not so bad, I mean, sometimes I'll get a little bit of heartburn and acid in the, in my mouth, but it depends on what I eat so I really try to stay away from some, some foods. So the PPI hasn't completely curbed the, the acid reflux, you still get it? Yeah, I still get it. It's definitely helped though it was a lot worse before, uh starting it. I've been on been on it now for a few years. OK, and as for your anxiety, do you ever get panic attacks? No, I haven't had any, any panic attacks. OK, alright. Do you have any allergies? No. OK, so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden, uh, was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual? Well, yeah, I mean yesterday I, or, yeah, I had a bit more to drink than, uh, usual, more alcohol I mean. So, I mean, could that have something to do with it? I'm not sure. It could potentially. Did you, were you, were you drunk and did you pass out? Yeah, I think so. My, my friends, uh yeah, that's what my friends were, were saying anyway. OK, and uh, talking about alcohol, how much do you usually drink? I usually, like, like four to six beers a day, but uh, yeah, yesterday was certainly more than that. Have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink? Has it affected you in any way? I mean I, I'm retired now so, uhm, I don't know, I, I feel like it's been fine maybe, uh, I feel like it's been fine. OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later. OK. And, uh, do you smoke? Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit. No, that's great. OK, do you plan on cutting it down further or do you wanna stay right there? Yeah I have been, have been trying, just too, too darn expensive these days, so, been trying to cut back. Yeah, yeah, that's fair, alright. What about marijuana? Do you consume marijuana? No, I don't. Any recreational drugs? Nope. Alright, do you have any family history of any medical problems? Uh yeah, my, my father had, uh, he ended up having liver disease actually, he passed away from that I think. And he had heart problems too. He was a lifelong smoker and didn't really, didn't really take care of himself. Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor? Uh, I do. I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though. Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often? I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so. OK, ok, I see, uhm, alright, and do you live alone or do you live with other people? Yeah, I live with my wife. OK, alright, and are you able to take care of things like groceries or finances, or shoveling snow or cleaning the house, or do you need any assistance with those sort of household activities? Yeah, we moved, uhm, actually into an apartment last year. It's made it a lot easier in terms of the housework and that sort of thing. But I've been able to, uhm, I do the the grocery shopping and share the the chores around, around the house. I do, I'll use a cane sometimes. I, I injured my knee a number of years ago, but other than that, things are OK. OK, OK, good to hear. That reminds me, have you had any surgeries in the past? Just on my, my left knee. I had a left knee replacement a few years ago. OK alright and have you any had, had any hospitalizations?

No, OK, alright and now I'm going to get you to um just palpate uh that lateral or yeah, the lateral aspect of that elbow and you let me know if you feel pain when you push, push on that. Uh there is pain at the lateral uh lateral elbow. How about the medial aspect? No pain. No pain, OK, and how about when you palpate your um forearm and your biceps? Uh no no pain. OK, alright and then do you feel like it's hot, that area? No. No, OK now I am going to get you to um extend your wrist. OK. And then keep your elbow in full extension as well. Does that hurt? Uh it does, yeah. Yeah, OK, how about when you flex your wrist with the elbow still in full extension? Uh it does, yeah that hurts as well. OK, how about when you flex your elbow? Uh no, that that doesn't cause any pain. OK. How about when you extend your shoulder all the way up? No, nothing there, that feels fine. OK, and then flexing your uh, or sorry abducting your shoulder? That feels normal. OK, alright, and then how about when you pronate and supinate your forearms? Uh, pronation um? So like twist your um arm inwards so that your palm is facing the floor. No, that doesn't really cause any pain, pronation and supination. OK, alright. Um alright, and then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions? Um I'm uh healthy. You're healthy, OK. And then UM do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? I had a surgery for um a C-section for uh my, my son, um but that's that's it. OK. OK, and um how long ago was that? That was about uh 17 years ago. OK. And was that an emergency C-section? Uh no, it was not. OK um and then are you on any medications?

OK. Any recent travel? Uh nope, I've been at home. OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you. Yeah, no worries.","Subjective:

And I'm just gonna ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble.

OK alright and when you stand up and walk how would you describe, are you having any kind of limping at all? Um a little bit of limp yeah, I'm putting more weight on the left leg. OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all? Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for? Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI. OK And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there. OK, sounds good. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care.","Subjective:

I did just say sorry, I I did just get out of the hospital so maybe I could have had some contact. There's some exposure there. OK, so so when did you get out of the hospital? Uhm, two days ago. Two days ago, OK, and what were you in the hospital for? Uhm? I had, I broke my hip. OK, and did you have a surgery for your hip? No. They didn't think it was, surgery was needed.

Yeah, I don't know. They haven't really been coming in and I I asked the nurse and she said she's gonna look into it. Maybe something went wrong there. OK, Um, and after you've been discharged, have you been moving around at all, or if you've been pretty immobilized? I try, but it's been it's been hard like, specially the first couple of days. I don't think it did much. But since then, I've been, I've been trying to move around a little bit more. OK. Have you noticed any kind of swelling in your legs at all? Uh, no. No, nothing like that? No. Have you previously had any kind of clots, like a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism? Anything like that? No. Have you had any previous diagnosis of cancer? I did in the past. About 10 years ago I had leukaemia. Leukaemia, OK. And are you still on any kind of treatment or do you see an oncologist or a mythologist? No, not anymore. Not anymore? OK.

Yeah, I do come. I'll have maybe two or three glasses of beer on the weekend. OK. Alright, so these are all this questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination next. Do you have any questions or concerns? No. OK, so yeah, right now one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot. We'll, we might do some imaging as well, so yeah, well, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there. Sure. So you'll be in here for a few hours until we get all those things done and see if you need any admission at all to the hospital. Sure. Alright. Thank you. Welcome, take care.","Subjective:

"I will ask some simple questions, okay? Hm How old are you and how would you define yourself in terms of ethnicity? Well, I am forty seven and would proudly call myself as Latin American. Great. What brings you to the emergency room? I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired. Okay. My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year.

I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss. I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. Which side left or right? I think its left. For how long? I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed.

Well, I am forty seven and would proudly call myself as Latin American. Great. What brings you to the emergency room? I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired. Okay. My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. Did you have wet cough? No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. Any shortness of breath? Nope. How about while sleeping or doing something else? Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss. I noticed one more thing.","<|begin_of_text|>I will ask some simple questions, okay?

Uhm, not over the counter medications, but like I tried to get her to like gargle with like salt water and all that kind of stuff, but that didn't seem to help. OK. And have her symptoms been just constant or do they come and go? They've been pretty constant. OK, and you think her symptoms are getting worse?

Has she traveled at all recently outside of the country or outside of the province? No, no, nothing like that. OK, and any headaches at all? Uhm, no. No, any nausea or vomiting? Uh, no, nothing like that. OK, any runny nose or congestion? No. No, OK. And have you had a chance to at all, look into her mouth and throat? And if you have, have you noticed any kind of redness, swelling? I haven't looked in there too much, like, just an inspection the other day, it looked a little bit red, but I didn't see any discharge. OK, and have you noticed any kind of swelling around her neck, ears, like, around her lymph nodes? Uhm, I haven't actually taken a look there. OK, we can do that. Other than those symptoms, has she been experiencing any kind of like fatigue or have you notice her being just very tired? Um, she has seemed a little bit more tired than usual. OK, and right now is she going to school or is right now all like virtual? Is she at home? Uhm, she's at home right now. OK, and does she have any symptoms of, any chest pain at all? No chest pain. OK, any changes in her bowel movements, any Constipation, diarrhea? No. OK, any urinary problems? No. OK, has she been able to sleep well or does she wake up a lot more at night?

OK, and have you noticed any kind of weight changes at all recently has she lost any weight? No OK, and, has she had any loss of taste, of smell or sorry, loss of sense of taste or smell at all. Uh, no. Any muscle aches or anything like that? Uh, no, nothing like that. OK, any exposure to fumes, dust, animals or Pets at Home? Uh, no, nothing like that. OK, has this happened at all in the past? Uhm, no. No, OK. Does she have any medical conditions at all that she's been diagnosed with in the past? Uhm, no, nothing like that.

So it was her uncle. He was diagnosed when he was forty five. OK, other than that, were there any developmental challenges at all while she was growing up? Did she, was she meeting her milestones? Any concerns at all? OK, and uh, in terms of her pregnancy, were there any, or your pregnancy with her, were there any complications at all either during the pregnancy or after she was born? And right now, where does she live, and who does she live with? she's at home with myself, my husband and she has one younger sibling. OK and, is everyone at home well, does anyone have any of these symptoms? No, OK. Right, so, and in terms of the home environment, does anyone smoke in the house? No. No OK, alright so I think that's all the questions I had right now. Do you have any questions or concerns? No, no questions, but uhm, actually, what do you think she has and how can we treat her? Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns? Uh no, that sounds great, thank you. You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there. OK, sounds great thanks. You're welcome. Take care. You too.","Subjective:

OK, and are you using, like the blue one, the blue one more at all, are you having to use the short acting one more? I'm definitely using the short acting more, like I'm using it almost every day.

Yeah, I've been taking all my medications. OK, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?

No. No, OK. and did they, when you were having shortness of breath, did you have a like a pneumonia or infection that you had to get antibiotics for any or anything like that? Uhm, no. Actually I might have gotten some antibiotics at one point, but not during that visit. OK. OK, And currently right now do you smoke? No, I stopped smoking two years ago. Yeah no, that's really good.

Like uh, do you get it from a store that sells the joint? Yeah, I get it from like a medical dispensary. OK, OK, I see. Yeah, I just want to make sure because some, if you get it from other sources there might be more irritants in there that can cause some of your symptoms and for them to get worse as well. So yeah. Oh I see, I see, OK. Yeah, and other than that, do you have any questions or concerns at all? No, what do you think I should do from, For now? Yeah, so right now what we're going to do is because you're having the coughing, shortness of breath, and you have a history of COPD & CHF, we definitely want to make sure that you're not having, uhm, what I think you might be having isn't just an exacerbation of your COPD, and especially with the green sputum it might be like a bacterial infection that's causing your symptoms to get worse, so we'll do all the appropriate testing, we'll do, a chest X-ray, we'll get some blood work done as well, w'ell give you some uh, Ventolin as well while you're here, and we might give you like a steroid medication as well. So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well, we need to, we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here. So yeah, let's just, I'll get back to you, we'll do some of those testing and then see where to go from there. Is that OK? Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. You're welcome.","Subjective:

"How old are you, sir? I'm sixty five years old. Are you right handed or left handed? I'm right handed. When was your last stroke? Well, it was on January seventeenth. I had these episodes where I was like always so confused and looks like I lost everything. All my memory and everything. And then they did a scan. It was verified that I was having a stroke on the same day. Did they put you on some medications? They gave me an anticonvulsant and aspirin. Are you taking them regularly? There have a few times like one or two days that I forgot to take my, uh, dyphenhydramine, but even when I'm taking it regularly, I'm still having all those symptoms or forgetfulness, confusion, and everything. Do you feel anything else along with these episodes like a urine urgency, tendency to bite your tongue, headaches, any visual change, or your heart is beating very fast? Any kind of weakness or numbness or shortness of breath? No nothing else, just the confusion and forgetfulness. How frequent are these episodes? Well, they occur like two or three times in a week. Each one of the episodes lasts for like one or two minutes.","Subjective:

Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse? If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps. OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest? No, I would say just on the left side. OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better? I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse. OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms? Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath. OK, um has anything like this ever happened to you before? No, no. I mean, I've never had any pain in my chest before. OK are you, did you have a loss of consciousness when you fell off your bike?

OK, and how many hours ago was that? I would say around 3 hours ago. OK. Um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? Uh, not other than just a hay fever, but nothing nothing else. I have like a lot of allergies. Any allergies to medications? Oh, just sometimes when I take like a nasal spray I think I might have an allergy to the steroids that they give me and sometimes also some of the antihistamines I think I get some allergies from them. OK. Uh, and any hospitalizations? No, never. Any surgeries? Nope. OK. Anybody in the family who have any illnesses? Just my father. He has type 2 diabetes but nothing else.

No, I got right back up. I just just had the pain. OK, so any injuries to the head? No. OK. That's fine. I was wearing a helmet. OK, excellent and any headache right now? No. OK, how about any fever chills? No, I feel I'm fine. Any nausea or vomiting? Nope. Do you feel as though your heart's racing? I would say like in the last hour a little bit more so than usual. OK. Any skin changes or or rashes you've noticed? Besides, just I got some scrapes here and there on my hands, but nothing else. OK, and do you have a cough? Nope. OK, and any recent infections? No, I've been pretty pretty healthy recently. No, no cough or no infections. OK, and uh, any dizziness? Um no. Alright, and I know you mentioned the few scratches on your hands, but any other injuries? Oh no, I I think I got a pretty lucky. Oh, OK. And any alcohol or drug intake prior to falling off your bike? Oh no, no, I was completely sober. No no drugs or alcohol. OK, and any weakness or numbness or tingling that you noticed? Um no nothing like that. Alright, and, when was the last time you had anything to eat or drink? I just had some cereal and, um, just some chocolate milk around breakfast time but nothing else. OK, and how many hours ago was that? I would say around","<|begin_of_text|>I was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency Department. So I came to the emergency Department because I've been having pain in my chest. OK, where is the pain located? I would say it's like the whole pretty much the left side of my chest. OK, and when did this pain start? So I think it started just around 2 hours ago. I actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on, kind of just slipped and I think I fell on that side like when I the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful. OK I am how would you describe the pain, sometimes people will use words like burning dull, achy. I think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area. OK, and um. Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse? If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps. OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest? No, I would say just on the left side. OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better? I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse. OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms? Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath.

"What brings you in? Uh I just came in today I think I broke my leg or something, it's something that was, I heard a snap, I was in um just a dance class um and we have like these long uh dresses, it it was a traditional dance class and my foot uh slipped right onto, it got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped and I I felt right on my, my leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down. I knew something was not right and something was broken. When did this happen? Just uh I would say like an hour ago Hour ago, OK. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all? No, not really. I I had to come in the ambulance. OK, OK, and um if you were to localize this pain, where exactly is it? It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful, but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg. The middle part, OK middle part of your lower leg, so kind of where your shins are? Mhmm. OK, so in the shin area, OK. Um have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour. Uh no nothing. I just like I just want to make sure I keep it as still as possible um I didn't wanna even try anything. OK yeah, that makes sense, if you were to describe this pain, would you say it's um sharp, dull, achy throbbing? It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life. OK, OK. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is it? At 10 for sure. Ten, OK, have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, um do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better? Uh I would say it's the same, it's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier. OK. OK and um so yeah, OK, um do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms? Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension. Um but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down. OK, OK. Um otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere in your body? No. How about any numbness or tingling in the area? Um I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, um but it like comes and goes. OK um and then how about how about any um like feelings of like losing sensation or feeling cold in that area? Um no, I I can feel everything in that area. OK. But it's hard to tell like it's just very painful right now. OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um how about headaches? No, no headaches. Uh any fainting or dizziness. No. Um confusion or memory loss? No. Um weight loss recently. No. Fevers or chills? No. Uh changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes? No, nothing that I've noticed. No, any changes to your vision, hearing, smell, or taste? No. Um how about coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing? No, no, nothing like that. No, OK, um how about chest pain or palpitations? No. No, any changes to your bowel movements? Uh no, not that I've noticed. Uh nausea or vomiting? Nope. Abdominal pain? No. Changes to urinary habits? No, nothing like that. No, OK, um and are you otherwise healthy? Yeah, I've been pretty healthy, I um don't take any medications regularly, I don't have any medical conditions. OK, that's good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? No, um just just for like my pregnancies, I had two pregnancies, both of them delivered vaginally, but no issues with that, just after that no hospitalizations or surgeries. OK, OK. Um and then um are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yep. OK, that's good. Um do you have any allergies? No, not that I know of. OK, um and then is there any family history of like musculoskeletal issues? Um so my mother has something called osteoporosis. OK, yep. Um but that's that's all that I can think of. How old was she when she was diagnosed with that? Um probably in her fifties. In her fifties, OK. Late fifties I would say. Um have you been, have you ever like been tested for that? No, I've never, I've never had testing. OK, all right. Um and then any family history of lung or heart conditions? No. Uh how about autoimmune conditions? Uh no, not that I know of. Any cancers? Uh, I think one of my aunts has uh ovarian cancer. OK, OK, um how old was she when she was diagnosed with that? Um like pretty uh recently, so probably like in her sixties. OK, OK, um and then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently? No. No, OK, have you done any travel recently? No. OK. Um those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component? No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible. OK, that sounds good, yeah we'll, we'll try our best. Thank you. Um OK, so now looking at your legs like side by side, do you notice any uh redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left? Yeah, it's all, it's all swollen and red and just looks so much different than my other leg. OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin? No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken. OK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin? No. No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area? Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry. OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area? No. No, OK, and then uh placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer? Yeah, I feel like it's it's warmer. OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees? No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try. OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg? No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible. OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK? That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much. OK, yeah, no worries.","Subjective:

"Would you mind by starting with what brought you in today? Yeah, so I'm just coming in with my son. He's six years old and yeah, just over the last few days he's not been himself and he's been having this stomach ache. Uh, so it started around like I would say 3 days ago and then he's also having vomiting for the last two days, he's vomited in total six times over the last two days and then yesterday he also developed a fever as well. I managed to measure it and it was 38.3 degrees Celsius. OK, I see. So I just so that I understand the timeline, so he started to have abdominal pain about 3 days ago, started with having vomiting and diarrhea two days ago and you checked his temperature, he had a fever as of yesterday? Yeah. OK, and uh, was there anything that that he ate that was different over over these last few days? No, we've been strictly home food during like a pandemic like no, no real changes. OK, and what's his kind of behavior been like over these last couple of days? Yeah, so at first with the stomach pain he was a bit just irritable and just not himself, but especially yesterday with the fever just been very quiet and just kind of sleeping pretty much the whole day. OK, I see and uh, could you describe the vomit? Yes, so vomit like, it started two days ago. The first day it was just like he puked up the things that he had eaten, but yesterday it was it was mainly just like uh just yellowish material, I couldn't really tell if it was food or not. OK, have you noticed any bile or blood in the vomit? Uh no I didn't notice any blood and I didn't notice any green material. It was mainly just like like normal vomit, like yellowish color. OK, I see and, has the what was the vomiting triggered by anything that you're aware of, like eating or drinking? Uhm? Yeah, two days ago it was it was after after lunch when he first vomited. But after that it's just been kind of random. I see OK, and, uh, and with regards to his diarrhea, has there been any any blood or or any color changes? No, no, I didn't notice any blood at all. It's definitely just very very watery and he's had to go probably even just in the last day, probably around like six or seven times. OK, um, and he's vomited how many times? So in total I can count 6 times. OK, and, has he been complaining of any headaches at all? No, not that I know. No. OK, and how about any ear pain or or eye pain? No, not that he's mentioned to me. OK, and any eye redness? Nope. OK, and as he had a runny nose? No, not really. OK and has he had a sore throat or any pain with swallowing? No. OK, have you had any loss of taste or loss of smell? Uh no, not that he has mentioned to me now. OK, and has he had a cough? Uh, no, not really. OK, and how about any shortness of breath or wheezing? No. OK, and has he had any any pain anywhere? Any chest pain? Um, he did, he did point to his stomach like it seems like he was having with all the vomiting like, he was having some stomach pain as well. OK, is there any specific location that that he's feeling the pain? Well, it's hard to say. He was just pointing at the center of his belly like, I don't know if it's like, I tried pressing on it and he didn't feel any pain then, but I think it's just kind of all over his stomach. OK, and has he had any urinary problems like painful voiding or been peeing more often? No, that's been OK. Have you noticed any rashes or skin changes? Uh, no, not not really, no. OK. And has he had any muscle aches or uh, or joint pains that that he's mentioned? No, no he hasn't mentioned anything like that. OK, and he's had a fever, has he had the chills? Yeah, so that's that's what I, that prompted me to take his temperature yesterday around the afternoon, like we had to wrap him up with like more than two blankets and he was still feeling cold so, yeah, definitely was having chills. OK, and and has there been any concerns with his growth, either weight or or height? So he's been going along the charts pretty well, like no concerns during his growth. Otherwise, he's a very healthy child. OK, so no medical diagnosis previously? No nothing like that. OK, and uh, yeah, is he meeting all developmental milestones OK? Like gross motor, fine motor, doing well at school? Yeah yeah, he didn't have any issues with walking, running, he's pretty social with all his peers. He's doing well at school, no complaints. OK, excellent and you know, no medical conditions, but has there been any reasons for being in the hospital before? No, not at all. We, yeah, we haven't really gone to the doctor with him after like all those vaccinations that he had to do, so he's been good. OK, great, so immunizations are up to date? Yeah, immunizations all up to date. Excellent and does he have any allergies? Uh, no, uh, not not anything that we know of yet. OK, and I just wanted to ask about his birth history. Were there any complications throughout throughout pregnancy, either mom being sick or having any any issues herself? No, so it was a normal vaginal delivery, uh no issues, uh he was born at 39 weeks, didn't need to stay in the hospital at all. Yeah, it was a pretty smooth pregnancy compared to some of the other ones. OK, oh, that's that's great. Do you remember the Apgar score or his birth weight? Uhm, I don't exactly remember his Apgar scores, I think they were like just just they they were normal like there was nothing concerning about them, and birth weight I think he was probably around 3 kilograms. OK, great so, yeah healthy birth weight at term it sounds like. And so, healthy, does he take any medications regularly? No, no medications. OK, and could you tell me about who is living with currently and then who's looking after him? Yeah, so he's living with myself, his mother and, and then my husband, and he has two older siblings. One is a boy, seven years old, and another one like a 10 year old girl. OK, and has anybody in the house been sick? Uh no, no one has been sick recently, however he does, they did let them go back into school at one point, so I don't know, I don't know, so that was just last week, so I don't know if he caught something from school. OK, but nobody that you know that's had similar symptoms? No. OK, and have you traveled anywhere? No, we've been, we've been at home. OK, uh, and then you know recent changes to anything in the diet you've mentioned? No, that's been fine. OK, and any concerns for safety in the home, whether physical or or verbal abuse? No, no concerns like that. OK, yeah a question that we have to ask everybody and is there any smoking in the home? No, no, we don't smoke. OK, great then, are there any pets? Nope, no pets. Alright, and uh and in the family, has there been anybody who's had any heart problems or any lung problems? Uh, we are getting the 10 year old tested for just uh, asthma. OK. But nothing diagnosed yet, no. OK, anybody in the family have any congenital diseases or any genetic diseases? No, not that I know of. OK, uh, anybody in the family have celiac disease or Crohn's disease? No, no, uh no history of any kind of bowel diseases. OK, so I think that's, uh, everything I want I wanted to ask about today. Uh, was there anything that maybe I I forgot to ask or or that I missed that you wanted to tell me? Uh, yeah, no it's, it's also just like I was just reading up like, can it be like I don't know if it can be COVID as well, if it can, it can do this as well? It is possible. Uh, it's uh, especially with nonspecific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations, and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain. But it also could be well, uh, another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will, I will go ahead and do a COVID test today, along with some other blood work. And maybe increase the hydration as well, because it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we will check electrolytes and go from there on the test results. Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.","Subjective:

"Hi there, I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today. I am just calling about my daughter. She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough. I see, OK. When did the fever and cough start? So they started around three to four days ago. And around the same time she was also having like a runny nose. OK, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time? Uh, yeah I would say they started around the same time and ah, they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days. OK, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough? Uh no, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed. OK, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms? Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me. OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same? I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like, especially today, but the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago. OK. Has she been sick like this before? She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was OK, um, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever? Uh Tylenol, I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back, uhm say like a few hours later. OK, and anything you notice that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days? Not anything that I know of. Her fevers been getting worse, but I don't really know why that is. OK, uh, has she been having any other symptoms? Um, other than like, yeah, she had that runny nose when it first started, and then she's also been having some diarrhea. OK, and when did the diarrhea start? I think I would say it started around two days ago. She's, like every time I change her diaper she would have like 4-5 different diaper changes throughout the day, and they they seem pretty liquid. So I OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour? Consistency, I'd say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and colour I didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour. OK. So you didn't think there was any blood in the stool? No, no, no, I didn't see any blood. OK, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it? So I used, we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit. OK. Uh, did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear? No, no, she doesn't seem to have any irritation there. OK, uh, how about any vomiting or regurgitation? No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there. OK, and notice any discharge from either eye? Uh, no. How about any discharge from ears? Not that I've noticed, no. Notice any rashes? Uh, no, I didn't not know like new rashes, no. OK and how is she been in terms of mood or or behaviour? Oh she's been pretty like she's not herself over the last few days. She's been crying a lot more, just very irritable. OK, would you say inconsolable at times? Sometimes like yesterday like she, I couldn't get her to stop crying. OK and uh, I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum? Yeah, I would say, uh, this green slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy. OK, um, how much would you say, uhm, like a cup, or more? I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time, she would cough up. OK, and did you notice any blood in it? No, I didn't notice any blood at all. OK, and with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing? Uh, I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths. I see, OK. Uh, is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking? Uh, no. I haven't noticed that. OK, and does her voice sound normal to you? Yeah, I think her note, her voice hasn't really changed that much. OK, um, with the noticing the faster rate of breathing is the breathing noisy at all? Uh, no, like she's not wheezing or anything. OK, and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing. Uh so like, uhm, like what do you mean by that? Like just so when she's breathing in and out. Is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs. Uh no, I I don't think I've noticed that, no. OK. And, and, have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth? Uh, no. OK, and any urinary problems? Uh, no, she's peeing fine. OK. And how has she been sleeping the last few days? She hasn't really been sleeping in between the crying and like just being so irritable. I think she's just very uncomfortable when she's trying to get to sleep, so OK. Any evidence of seizure or limb jerking? Uh no, not that I've noticed. No, OK. And and have you notice an her being like really lethargic at all? Uh, she's not herself and she's still like pretty active, like she's, she just seems really unhappy and irritated. But no, she still has energy. OK. And uh, is she drinking yeah, a lot more fluids or or a lot less? How is she tolerating oral intake? I would say I think she's more on the dryer side like she, her mouth is very dry. Her lips are like all cracked, and she it seems that she's drinking I see, OK. And, uh, how many wet diapers would you say in the last 24 hours? Um? Yeah, it's difficult to say. I think I like yesterday changed four to five times. They were all diarrhea, so not really sure, but maybe around 5. OK, and have you guys traveled anywhere recently? No. No, we've been here. OK, so next just some questions about past medical history. Uh, has she had any medical problems in the past? The only thing I could think of was after she was born, she had to be given the light treatment for like jaundice, but after that no other problems. OK. And any prior surgeries? No. Any previous hospitalizations? No, just the light treatment, but other than that nothing. OK, and throughout pregnancy were there any complications? No, my pregnancy was completely normal. No complications during the pregnancy. OK, so no gestational diabetes or hypertension? Uh, no. OK and uh, were you sick at all at any point with infectious symptoms? No, everything came back clear. All the tests were normal. OK, and um. Any allergies to medications? No allergies. OK, and is she currently taking any medications? No, just tried the Tylenol but it didn't really seem to work. OK, and has she been around anybody sick recently? Just her big brother who goes to daycare was also like a bit sick with a cough and some runny nose for the last four days. But, uhm, he didn't have a fever and he seemed to recover pretty fast but seems she may have caught it from him. OK, and anybody in the family um, have any similar symptoms right now? I guess besides her brother? No, just just her and her brother. OK. And, and in regards to birth, birth history, was it a vaginal delivery or C-section? It was a normal vaginal delivery at 38 weeks there were no problems after the delivery or before the delivery. OK, and uh are her immunizations up to date? Yeah uh, all our immunizations are up to date. OK, and um, in regards to growth and development, have you had any concerns? Uh, no, we've been getting her checked regularly. It seems that she's been growing well and developing well. OK, and who is the primary caregiver for at home? Primary caregiver, right now I'm staying home with her and her brother goes to daycare. So yeah, it would be me. OK. Uh, and could you tell me about her eating habits and typical appetite? Uh, so now like she is able to eat like everything like vegetables, fruits, breads and meat, but over the last few days she has been just irritable with everything. So even eating food has just not been great for the last few days. OK, and when was her last checkup? So it was around one month ago and everything was fine then. No concerns from the doctor. OK.

- Monitor for signs of respiratory distress, dehydration, or worsening symptoms
- Follow-up with PCP if not improving in 2-3 days or sooner if worsening","<|begin_of_text|>Hi there, I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today. I am just calling about my daughter. She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough. I see, OK. When did the fever and cough start? So they started around three to four days ago. And around the same time she was also having like a runny nose. OK, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time? Uh, yeah I would say they started around the same time and ah, they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days. OK, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough? Uh no, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed. OK, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms? Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me. OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same? I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like, especially today, but the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago. OK. Has she been sick like this before? She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was OK, um, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever? Uh Tylenol, I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back, uhm say like a few hours later. OK, and anything you notice that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days? Not anything that I know of. Her fevers been getting worse, but I don't really know why that is. OK, uh, has she been having any other symptoms? Um, other than like, yeah, she had that runny nose when it first started, and then she's also been having some diarrhea. OK, and when did the diarrhea start? I think I would say it started around two days ago. She's, like every time I change her diaper she would have like 4-5 different diaper changes throughout the day, and they they seem pretty liquid. So I OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour? Consistency, I'd say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and colour I didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour. OK. So you didn't think there was any blood in the stool? No, no, no, I didn't see any blood. OK, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it? So I used, we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit. OK. Uh, did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear? No, no, she doesn't seem to have any irritation there. OK, uh, how about any vomiting or regurgitation? No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there. OK, and notice any discharge from either eye? Uh, no. How about any discharge from ears? Not that I've noticed, no. Notice any rashes? Uh, no, I didn't not know like new rashes, no. OK and how is she been in terms of mood or or behaviour? Oh she's been pretty like she's not herself over the last few days. She's been crying a lot more, just very irritable. OK, would you say inconsolable at times? Sometimes like yesterday like she, I couldn't get her to stop crying. OK and uh, I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum? Yeah, I would say, uh, this green slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy. OK, um, how much would you say, uhm, like a cup, or more? I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time, she would cough up. OK, and did you notice any blood in it? No, I didn't notice any blood at all. OK, and with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing? Uh, I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths. I see, OK. Uh, is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking? Uh, no. I haven't noticed that. OK, and does her voice sound normal to you? Yeah, I think her note, her voice hasn't really changed that much. OK, um, with the noticing the faster rate of breathing is the breathing noisy at all? Uh, no, like she's not wheezing or anything. OK, and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing. Uh so like, uhm, like what do you mean by that? Like just so when she's breathing in and out. Is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs. Uh no, I I don't think I've noticed that, no. OK. And, and, have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth? Uh, no. OK, and any urinary problems? Uh, no, she's peeing fine. OK. And how has she been sleeping the last few days? She hasn't really been sleeping in between the crying and like just being so irritable. I think she's just very uncomfortable when she's trying to get to sleep, so OK. Any evidence of seizure or limb jerking? Uh no, not that I've noticed. No, OK. And and have you notice an her being like really lethargic at all? Uh, she's not herself and she's still like pretty active, like she's, she just seems really unhappy and irritated. But no, she still has energy. OK. And uh, is she drinking yeah, a lot more fluids or or a lot less? How is she tolerating oral intake? I would say I think she's more on the dryer side like she, her mouth is very dry.","<|begin_of_text|>Hi there, I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today.

"What brought you in today? Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned. OK, I see. When did the chest pain start? So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago. OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of? No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain. It's kind of like in my right side of the chest and it feels like a stabbing pain. OK, and so the pain comes on when you breathe in, or yeah, when you take a deep breath. Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away? Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in. OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better? Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it. OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down? Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think. OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on? Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow. I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before? No, never. OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches? No. How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough? I have been having a little bit of a cough, but that's it, like, it kind of started today, but it's nothing too significant. OK, alright, is the cough dry or have you brought up sputum? It is dry. OK, and have you had a sore throat? Uh, no. How about a loss of taste or a loss of smell? No. OK, how has your appetite been? My appetite's been pretty good. It's like, definitely with the pain, I don't really feel like eating today, but I don't think it's changed. OK, so has your weight been stable over the last several months. Yeah, weight has been stable. OK, and have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats? Uhm, Nope. OK, and have you had any episodes where you feel like your heart is, like, racing or beating out of your chest? No, I don't think so. Any dizziness or Lightheadedness? No. OK, and have you had any wheezing? No, I don't think so. OK, and with the cough, have you brought up any blood? No. OK, and have you had any, Uh, like urinary problems? No. Any bowel problems like diarrhea or Constipation? No, nothing like that. And any abdominal pain? No. Have you had any nausea or vomiting? No. OK, and have you had any muscle aches, joint pains or skin changes? No. OK, and uhm, in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? No, I've been pretty healthy. OK, so do you take any medications regularly? No, nothing at all. And do you have any allergies? No, no allergies. Any hospitalizations in the past or any surgeries? No. OK, and currently, can you tell me just a little bit about your living situation? Yeah, so I just live with uh, a couple of my roommates. I'm going to University. OK. I live in like a student housing situation. OK, has anybody in the house been sick or anybody that you've been around been sick? No, we've been all pretty healthy. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes or use any like vape products or anything like that? No, I haven't ever smoked. I do smoke weed like, I would say, once or twice a week. OK, and how much would you say? Like 1 gram or less or? 1 gram probably lasts like 2 weeks. OK, and do you drink alcohol? Yeah, just a couple of beers maybe on the weekend. OK, and are you currently sexually active? Yeah, just one partner, my girlfriend. OK, and, do you use condoms? Yeah, we use condoms, we're pretty safe. OK, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before? No, never. OK, any concerns right now or anything like that? No, uh, we've been pretty safe and we've both been tested before and everything, so I'm not really concerned. OK, great and has anybody in the family had like a similar presentation before, like any lung problems or heart problems? No, I think my sister, she has asthma, but that's about it. OK, and uh, any cancers that run in the family? Not that I know of. OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there. OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all? I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened. OK, alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.","Subjective:

Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned.

So yeah, I would say 1 day ago. OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of? No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain.

Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away? Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in. OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better? Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it. OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down? Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think. OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on? Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow. I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before? No, never. OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches? No. How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough? I have been having a little bit of a cough, but that's it, like, it kind of started today, but it's nothing too significant. OK, alright, is the cough dry or have you brought up sputum? It is dry. OK, and have you had a sore throat? Uh, no. How about a loss of taste or a loss of smell? No. OK, how has your appetite been? My appetite's been pretty good. It's like, definitely with the pain, I don't really feel like eating today, but I don't think it's changed. OK, so has your weight been stable over the last several months. Yeah, weight has been stable. OK, and have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats? Uhm, Nope.

OK, so do you take any medications regularly? No, nothing at all. And do you have any allergies? No, no allergies. Any hospitalizations in the past or any surgeries? No. OK, and currently, can you tell me just a little bit about your living situation? Yeah, so I just live with uh, a couple of my roommates. I'm going to University. OK. I live in like a student housing situation. OK, has anybody in the house been sick or anybody that you've been around been sick? No, we've been all pretty healthy.

"Hi there, what's going on? Guest_family: I am her daughter. I brought her to the emergency. She lives in a skilled nursing home.

"Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, doctor. You're forty four, correct? Yes sir. Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir? Well, doctor, I've had lower back pain for a while now. Does the pain go into your legs? Yeah, I have pain in my right thigh too. Is there an injury associated with this pain? Yes, I had an incident back in nineteen ninety four. Do you have any paperwork or medical records from the initial injury? No sir, I don't have those today. What do you do for a living, sir? Right now, I work at Taco Bell. I have a workers comp claim open. Your pain came back while working there, correct? Yes, that's correct. Do you remember when your last appointment here was?

It was at L four L 5. Have you had any imaging done on the lower back? Yes, I had an M R I on October eighteenth two thousand four. I have the report right here. Okay, this shows multi level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L two L three, L three L four, and L five S1, with no neural impingement, which is good. What does that mean, doctor? In summary, you have a significant amount of arthritis in the back. Oh yeah, I had an M R myelogram as well, here's the report. Okay, this shows severe spinal stenosis at L three L four, but it may have been artifact. What does that mean? This finding may be a misinterpretation.","Subjective:

"I was wondering if we could start with you telling us what brought you in? Sure, I've had this terrible headache for the past four days. Doesn't seem to be getting any better, and I feel hot like I have a fever. I've been coughing a lot so I am I'm worried I have COVID, so I'm here. OK. So I'll start with the headaches. When did when did that exactly started? Uh the headache started, OK so the coughing started four days ago. The headache started shortly after so I would say later on during that day and then the fever I've had for, fever I think I've had for the past two days. I haven't actually taken my temperature though. OK um. So, uh, the cough is started four days ago. Has the cough gotten better, worse, or stayed the same? The cough has stayed the same. OK, are you bringing up any phlegm or sputum with the cough? Um, it's not really phlegm, but sometimes I cough up, like bits of like. You know little bits that look like blood or something. OK, so you're seeing some like red when when you're coughing up? Mmmm OK, and how much of this are you seeing like, is it like a teaspoon amount or or more? Oh, it's it's very little. It's like maybe a little bit bigger than like the tip of a pencil. Oh OK, are you, OK, are you seeing this on like kind of tissues afterwards sort of thing? Yeah. OK, um and any triggers for the cough you can think of? No, it just seems to be there all day. Um, doesn't really get better with me trying to rest or not. OK, and is the cough there at night time too? Yes, it is definitely there at night. OK, um is it interfering with sleep? Ah yes, I haven't been sleeping well. OK, um, and with your cough have you had any difficulties with breathing? Um, no. Alright, and now, how about any wheezing? No wheezing. OK. And with this headache when it first came on, did you experience a like worst headache of your life, or a Thunder clap sensation? No, it's it's not that bad, but it just seems to be there all day long. OK, um have you had headaches like this before? No, I've never gotten headaches in the past. OK, uh is the headache associated with any nausea or vomiting? No. OK, and is the headache worse in the morning when you first wake up? No. OK, and does it have to get worse if you lie flat? No. OK, and has this headache been getting worse, staying the same, getting better? It's it's about the same. OK. Um and, um and you haven't checked the temperature yet, you said, but you felt hot? Yes, that's right. OK, any other symptoms that you've been experiencing? Not that I can think of. OK, there's just a few others that I wanted to ask about to be comprehensive. Have you had any eye pain or ear pain? No. How about any discharge from either your eyes or ears? No, nothing like that. Alright, have you had any changes to either your sense of smell or your sense of taste? No. Alright, and have you had a runny nose at all? Um no. And how about a sore throat? No. OK, and um, have you had any chills? Um no chills. How about night sweats? Um no nothing like that. I see, OK and over the last few months has your weight changed? Ah no, not that I noticed. OK, um have you been feeling tired or fatigued? No. OK, and have you had any chest pain? Um no. Alright, and how about any heart palpitations? None. Alright, in any episodes of feeling really dizzy or lightheaded. No. OK, and how about any fainting spells or feeling like you might faint? No, nothing like that. OK. And have you had any abdominal pain? Um no, no abdominal pain. Any diarrhea or constipation? No. How about any painful urination or feeling as though you need to urinate really frequently? Ah no nothing like that. OK, and have you had any skin changes like rashes or anything like that? No. OK, and how about any muscle aches or joint aches or just overall like body pains? Mmm no, not that I that not. Not that I've noticed, no. OK, is there anything in regards to your past health that you see a physician regularly for? Um No. Ah actually I I think at one point, um, I was worked up for something called familial hypercholesterolemia because it ran in the family. But I think those results were normal. OK, so do you, um, do you take a statin medication then? Yeah I take a low dose statin. OK, and when was your last lipid panel checked? I think it was two years ago. I see, and um do you remember if the LDL was normal at that time? Ah yes it was normal. OK, but since the, it was about two years ago, it might be worthwhile today just to also check a lipid panel just to be safe, but that'll be something we can talk about that more so at the end if that's OK. Sure, yeah, that would be great. OK, and any other medical conditions? No. OK. Have you had any surgeries before? C-section. How many children do you have? Ah just the one. OK, and were there any complications with the c-section? Um no no complications. OK, any reasons for hospitalizations? Nope. OK, any allergies to medications? No. Alright, any medications besides the statin that you take? Nope. OK, and in regards to your family history, have there been people who've had early heart attacks or strokes in the family? No. OK, but you do have familial hypercholesterolemia, do you have family members who have that? Yes OK so my Aunts had it, as well as my mother. OK um. And has there been any lung conditions that run in the family? Um, no lung conditions. How about any malignancy's or or cancers? Ah there was colon cancer on my dad side of the family, but I'm not too sure who had it. OK, have you heard of anybody having breast cancer? Breast cancer no. Alright, and how about ovarian cancer? No ovarian cancer. OK. And next I actually wanted to ask a few questions about your personal and lifestyle habits, but first, could you just tell me a little bit about your living situation right now? I live with my husband and my one son. OK, and sorry, how old is your son? He is 10. OK, um is anybody in the home been sick recently? No. OK, and how about is there anybody at work? At work no. No one's been sick. OK, have you traveled anywhere recently? We went up to we just went to um like a, we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we weren't wearing masks, but we, it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern. OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike? Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that. I see OK. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. Um, do you smoke marijuana? Um no. OK, and do you drink alcohol? I don't. Do you use any other recreational drugs? Um no. OK, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Oh, actually one thing that I I did want to, I forgot to ask was, do you have any neck stiffness? No, not that I noticed. OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot? No, I think you covered it all. I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else? Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations. OK great, thank you. Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started. OK, sounds great.","Subjective:

"How may I help you? I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder. OK and when, when did this pain start? It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week. OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either. OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away. I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week. OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back? It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder. OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key? It's more achy. OK. But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp. OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse? Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts. OK, and have you done anything that's made it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder. OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then. Yeah. OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10. Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now. OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder? Mmmm OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder? Um no not that I know of. OK, have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK, have you had any skin rashes or or skin changes? No. OK so even over the area you haven't noticed any redness or like soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK, how about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK, have you had pains and any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK And. Um, Have you had any recent infections or or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting? Um nope. OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side. OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night? Yup. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm? Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell. OK, And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back? It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up. OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased? Mmm OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling? No, I haven't felt any of that. OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea? Nope, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? Nope. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago. OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK, do you take any medications regularly? Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it. OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with, and whereabouts? Yeah, so I'm living with with my wife in a small condominium in downtown. OK, and are you working currently? Yeah, I'm working as a real estate agent. OK, uh, and do you drink alcohol? Rarely just on some occasions, but not regularly. No. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis? No, I've never smoked. Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past? Nope OK. Um. And so so the next part, just for the physical exam. So do you have pain with shoulder AB duction. Uhm yes. So just to yeah, I do have some pain. Especially from. Yeah yeah pain throughout AB duction. OK, is there any like pain that's like parts of that that range of motion that are more painful for you? yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees is more painful. OK. And. If your arm is outstretched and your thumb pointing down so your arm is internally rotated does that give you pain? Yeah, if yeah, not not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it it the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain. OK. OK, so it sounds like a positive jobes test and a positive Neer's test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation? Uh. Just to, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder there is some some pain over with palpation. OK, that sensation is normal, reflexes are normal and strength is slightly reduced as well. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I maybe forgot? No, I think that's it. OK, um so based onI know that the symptoms today along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having a rotator cuff tear or um a rotator cuff impingement syndrome and where there is inflammation there not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So, uh, those would be the two most likely things. Yeah, their rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we were going to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging such as an X Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder. OK, sounds good. Thank you.","Subjective:

I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder. OK and when, when did this pain start? It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week. OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either. OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away. I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week. OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back? It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder. OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key? It's more achy. OK. But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp. OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse? Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts. OK, and have you done anything that's made it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder. OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then. Yeah. OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10. Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now. OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder? Mmmm OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder? Um no not that I know of. OK, have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK, have you had any skin rashes or or skin changes? No. OK so even over the area you haven't noticed any redness or like soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK, how about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK, have you had pains and any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK And. Um, Have you had any recent infections or or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting? Um nope. OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side. OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night? Yup. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm? Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell. OK, And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back? It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up. OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased? Mmm OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling? No, I haven't felt any of that. OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea? Nope, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? Nope. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago. OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK, do you take any medications regularly? Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it. OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK, and could you","<|begin_of_text|>How may I help you?

"So what brings you in? Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned. Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four? Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time. OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm? Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material. White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes? It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat. OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled? I would say it's harsh. Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to? Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well. OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this? No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly. OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing? Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine. You're fine now, OK, uh, alright. And sorry, forgot to ask you earlier, do you see any blood in your phlegm? No, no, I haven't noticed any blood. OK, any uh changes to your hair or on your skin, like rashes? Not that I've noticed, no. OK, any weight loss? Um, I don't think so. OK, fevers? No. OK, exhaustion? Um yeah, I would say like for the last few months I am a bit more tired. Mhmm OK, how about changes in your vision or hearing? No, I haven't experienced that. How about a stuffy nose? Runny nose? Uh no, not really. No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste? Uh nope. No, OK. Uh chest pain? Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest. Oh, yeah. But it tends to go away with uh just some rest. Oh OK, OK. Um how about palpitations? Like feeling like your heart is racing? Uh no, I don't think so. No, OK. How about some swelling in your limbs? I I did notice, like uh a little bit of swelling in my uh both my, like right by my ankles. My shoes, like like even when I wear my socks, it like leaves little marks and then uh I just feel my like my shoes are tighter. OK, OK and how long has that been going on? Probably, uh, I've had this issue for like a pretty long time um, probably I would say the last year at least. OK, OK, last year. Um any uh dizziness or fainting spells? No. No, OK, any memory issues, uh confusion? No. Numbness or tingling? No, nothing like that. No headaches? Uh no, no headaches. Changes to your bowel movements? No, I tend to go like once a day. And yeah, it's pretty normal. OK, uh nausea or vomiting? No. No, OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding conditions? I know you said you have COPD, anything else? I do have high blood pressure. OK. Do you have something called congestive heart failure? Uh no, what's that? OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs. Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that. I just thought that was uh, it's been going on for a while now and didn't really bother me too much. OK. Um alright, and are you taking any medications? Yeah, I have this medication uh right now I'm taking it, it's called lisinopril. OK, so that's for your blood pressure? Yeah. OK. Are you on any puffers? Sorry, go ahead. Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer. Yeah. And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva. OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits? Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help. OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though? Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective. OK, yeah. Um OK. And have you had any recent blood work done? Uh, no, I haven't been to the doctor for a while. OK. And do you have any allergies? Um I think I have allergies to uh like um amoxicillin, I got like a rash once. OK. Have you had any, uh, amoxicillin, or like penicillin type antibiotics recently? No. No, OK. Um are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yep. OK. Um, you're not quite at this age range yet, but uh we do recommend the pneumococcal vaccine when you turn 65. And um did you get the flu vaccine this year? Uh yeah I did, with the pandemic going on, I usually don't get it, but I got it this year. OK, good good. Um any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions? Uhm, lung conditions I don't think so. Heart conditions, uh my father did have a heart attack in his 60s, but he's fine. He's he's living right now. OK OK, any cancers? Cancers, I think my uncle from my father's side um had uh bladder cancer. OK, OK. Um do you smoke? I used to smoke. Um I just quit a few years ago. OK, congrats. Um how much did you used to smoke? Uhm, I don't know, probably I went through a like a whole pack every day, I would say for at least 30 years of my life. OK, OK um so it's good that you stopped. Um do you take any other recreational drugs? Uh no, nothing like that. No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink? Uh I drink every like, maybe a beer a day. OK. Um are you um living with anyone right now? Yeah, it's just uh me and my wife. OK, where do you guys live? Uh we just live uh outside of the city in in a condominium. OK, any uh old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos, anything like that in the condo? No, it's pretty well maintained. OK, good. And have you been in contact with any anyone sick recently? No, I've mainly just been trying to stay inside. I work from home too, so haven't really been seeing anyone. OK, that's good. And um travel to anywhere recently? Outside the province? Uhm, outside of the province, no, not not for like the last year at least. OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be. Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound? OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test. OK, sounds good. Yeah, no problem.","Subjective:

Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat. OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled? I would say it's harsh. Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to? Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well. OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this? No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly. OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing? Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine. You're fine now, OK, uh, alright. And sorry, forgot to ask you earlier, do you see any blood in your phlegm? No, no, I haven't noticed any blood. OK, any uh changes to your hair or on your skin, like rashes? Not that I've noticed, no. OK, any weight loss? Um, I don't think so. OK, fevers? No. OK, exhaustion? Um yeah, I would say like for the last few months I am a bit more tired. Mhmm OK, how about changes in your vision or hearing? No, I haven't experienced that. How about a stuffy nose? Runny nose? Uh no, not really. No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste? Uh nope. No, OK. Uh chest pain? Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest. Oh, yeah. But it tends to go away with uh just some rest. Oh OK, OK. Um how about palpitations? Like feeling like your heart is racing? Uh no, I don't think so. No, OK. How about some swelling in your limbs? I I did notice, like uh a little bit of swelling in my uh both my, like right by my ankles. My shoes, like like even when I wear my socks, it like leaves little marks and then uh I just feel my like my shoes are tighter. OK, OK and how long has that been going on? Probably, uh, I've had this issue for like a pretty long time um, probably I would say the last year at least. OK, OK, last year. Um any uh dizziness or fainting spells? No. No, OK, any memory issues, uh confusion? No. Numbness or tingling? No, nothing like that. No headaches? Uh no, no headaches. Changes to your bowel movements? No, I tend to go like once a day. And yeah, it's pretty normal. OK, uh nausea or vomiting? No. No, OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding conditions? I know you said you have COPD, anything else? I do have high blood pressure. OK. Do you have something called congestive heart failure? Uh no, what's that? OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs. Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that. I just thought that was uh, it's been going on for a while now and didn't really bother me too much. OK. Um alright, and are you taking any medications? Yeah, I have this medication uh right now I'm taking it, it's called lisinopril. OK, so that's for your blood pressure? Yeah. OK. Are you on any puffers? Sorry, go ahead. Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer. Yeah. And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva. OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits? Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help. OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though? Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective. OK, yeah. Um OK. And have you had any recent blood work done? Uh, no, I haven't been to the doctor for a while. OK. And do you have any allergies? Um I think I have allergies to uh like um amoxicillin, I got like a rash once. OK. Have you had any, uh, amoxicillin, or like penicillin type antibiotics recently? No. No, OK.

Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned. Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four? Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time.

Not really, I haven't uh, nothing's really helped. Um I also tried a cough syrup, um it didn't, it helped for a couple hours, but then it was back again. The cough was back again. OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past? Uh well, I I said yeah when I get a cold. Mhmm, OK. Once a year maybe. Once a year? OK. Um do you experience any shortness of breath with this cough? No. No, OK. Is it a dry cough or do you bring up any phlegm? No, it's a dry cough. OK, uh any blood that you've seen? No, no. No, OK.

No, OK. Any joint pain? No. No, numbness or tingling? No. Headaches? No. No, OK. Are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions? I have diabetes. OK, how long have you had diabetes? It's about, it's been uh seven years now. OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? No. OK and um how about medications? Are you on any? Uh yeah, I've been taking uh metformin for the past uh, for the past five years, when, five or six years. OK. Um and uh my family Doc started me on uh ramipril about two weeks ago, he told me that uh now that I'm 50, I need to I need to be on this pill as well, so now I have to take 2 pills instead of one. OK. Yeah because I think it's it's good for my heart or something. Yeah, for sure. So you started that two weeks ago, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations? Uh yeah, I think so. OK, any allergies? Uhm penicillin, I just get uh I get a rash. I got a rash when I was a child, I haven't had it since then. OK, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? Uh no, nothing like that. No, OK. Do you smoke? Uh, no. No, how about, uh, marijuana or other recreational drugs? No. No, OK, um alcohol? Uh yeah, I drink on the weekends.

Um not that I'm aware of. No, OK. OK, well it seems like um those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own? Uh no, I just want to get tested for Covid. Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril. Sure. Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound? Sounds great. OK, great, thank you.","Subjective:
