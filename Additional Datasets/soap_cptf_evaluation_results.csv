She reports that she has been experiencing these symptoms for several days prior to her visit. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She also has a family history of heart disease.

**Initial Assessment**

* Vital signs: Tachycardia (120 bpm), mild tachypnea (24 breaths/min), mild hypotension (90/60 mmHg)
* Physical examination: The patient appears uncomfortable and dehydrated
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): Leukocytosis (12,000 cells/mm^3) with an elevated white blood cell differential showing neutrophilia

"It sounds like that you're experiencing some chest pain. Yeah, so this chest pain has just been coming on for the last couple of weeks now. OK, uhm. So 2 weeks, and can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain? Um yeah, I'm I'm just feeling this chest discomfort, sort of over on the left side. The left side, OK. Does does it stay just in one spot or does it kind of spread anywhere else? No, I don't really feel it anywhere else. Yeah, I just feel it in that one spot on the left side. OK, does it feel dull and achy, or does it feel more sharp? It feels pretty sharp. OK, and is it constant like on all the time, or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes? It comes and goes. I would say I it might last for um 20-30 minutes at a time and then it goes away. OK, and over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worse? Uh, no. It's been about the same. About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes? No, it's happened about two or three times during the 2 weeks. And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst pain you've ever felt, where would it fall? I would say a 4 out of 10. OK. Uh, can you think of anything that that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain? Um, I don't know I've separated from my husband 2 two years ago which has been really stressful but other than that I mean I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently. OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general? Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life. OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away? Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped. OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes? Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving. OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before? No, I haven't had anything like this happen before. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? No, previously healthy. And just jumping back to these pain episodes when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any nausea or vomiting? No. OK, do you get any, do you have any difficulty breathing during these times? No, I haven't. OK, and have you noticed any fevers? Uh, no, no fevers. OK, have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick recently? Uhm, no, I haven't. And have you traveled anywhere outside of Canada? No, I've been home. OK so you have, you said you have been previously healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medications? Uhm, I do not, no medications, just the Tylenol and Advil I tried for the pain. OK, do you have any allergies? No allergies. And is there any history of heart problems in your family? Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year and it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I thought I was having. For sure, it always feels very concerning when when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had issues like similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations, that's a really tough thing to do so, good for you. That's that's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol? Um, I do, but, uh, I'll have maybe one or two glasses of wine on the weekend. Do you use any other substances? Uh no. I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specific things like have you ever been told you have high blood pressure? No, I've never been told I've I've had high blood pressure. And have you ever been told you have like high cholesterol? I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either. OK, and do you exercise regularly? Yeah, actually, I'll either do some running or cycling, probably three or four days per week and I haven't had any chest pain or or problems exercising. OK, that's good to hear. And have you ever had problems with heartburn? Uh. I don't think so, no. OK. OK, so just to kind of summarize what we've talked about, over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain that's on the left side, it feels more sharp, is that correct? Yeah. And it's kind of constant when it comes on, there's nothing really that makes it better or worse, it just kind of goes away on its own after half an hour or so, it has kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks, hasn't really gotten worse or better, it hasn't gone away either? Right, yeah exactly. You never had anything like that before and you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life, it definitely can play into that as well. OK, is there anything else that you wanted to to tell me about that I didn't ask you today? Uh, no, I think that's um, yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today.

Physical examination revealed no obvious signs of infection or trauma. Laboratory tests showed elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which were significantly higher than normal. Imaging studies (ultrasound) revealed multiple small nodules on the liver. The patient's mother reported that her child had been playing outside for several hours before getting bitten by ants. The mother also mentioned that she had recently purchased the ant bait from a local store.

The physician diagnosed the patient as having acute liver damage due to ingestion of boron-containing insecticide. The treatment plan included supportive care, including intravenous fluids and monitoring of vital signs, as well as administration of activated charcoal to absorb the toxin. The patient was discharged home after 24 hours of observation. However, the patient developed severe abdominal pain and vomiting again within 48 hours of discharge. The physician suspected that the patient may have ingested more of the ant bait and decided to re-evaluate the situation. A repeat ultrasound scan confirmed the presence of additional nodules on the liver. The physician then ordered further imaging studies, including CT scans, to evaluate the extent of the disease. These studies revealed multiple large nodules throughout the liver, indicating widespread liver damage. The physician recommended that the patient undergo surgery to remove the affected livers.

Medical History:

* The patient is a non-smoker.
* She has a history of hypertension.
* She has had a recent viral upper respiratory infection (URI) which was treated with antibiotics.
* She has a family history of allergies.

Physical Examination:

* Vital signs: Tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypoxemia.
* Physical examination reveals bilateral periorbital puffiness and conjunctival injection.
* Neurological examination shows mild stiffness and tenderness in the neck muscles.
* Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Imaging Studies:

* CT scan of the head and neck reveals no structural abnormalities.
* MRI of the brain shows no significant changes.

Diagnosis:

The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of meningitis, likely bacterial, given the presence of fever, headache, and neck stiffness. However, the lack of structural abnormalities on imaging studies makes it difficult to confirm this definitively.

Treatment:

* The patient requires intravenous antibiotics to treat the suspected bacterial cause of her symptoms.
* She will be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and observation.

* Continue to monitor the patient closely for signs of worsening symptoms or complications.

OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start? Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain. OK. Any fevers? Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that.

No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so. OK, that's good. Has he had a cough? Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on. OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough? Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday. Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm? No, it seems to be just dry. I think I just noticed it like three or four times during the day yesterday. OK, so no blood that he's bringing up right? No, no.

Uhm, no, I don't think anyone's been sick around him. OK and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Uh, no, like, he's mainly just been inside his home. OK. has he ever had ear pain before? He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one. OK, was he prescribed any medications? Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time. OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time. No, I think that, only that one I can recall. OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy? Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that. No hospitalizations or surgeries? No. And is he on any medications? No medications. OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations? Yeah, all his immunizations are good. OK, any allergies? Not that we know of so far. And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions. No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all. OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac? Fairly young I would say, in his 20s. OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well. OK. Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner? Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog. OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house? We live in a, it's like a condominium. OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building? No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept. OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that? No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child. OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn? Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards. OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own? Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend? Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins, we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. OK yeah, no worries.","<|begin_of_text|>What brings you in?

You're saying that he's been feeling irritable lately, and that's why he's been having this ear pain. Is that correct?

OK, and uh, how well has your gerd been controlled? Uh, it kind of, it bugs me most days, its not so bad, I mean, sometimes I'll get a little bit of heartburn and acid in the, in my mouth, but it depends on what I eat so I really try to stay away from some, some foods. So the PPI hasn't completely curbed the, the acid reflux, you still get it? Yeah, I still get it. It's definitely helped though it was a lot worse before, uh starting it.

OK, and uh, talking about alcohol, how much do you usually drink? I usually, like, like four to six beers a day, but uh, yeah, yesterday was certainly more than that. Have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink? Has it affected you in any way? I mean I, I'm retired now so, uhm, I don't know, I, I feel like it's been fine maybe, uh, I feel like it's been fine. OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later. OK. And, uh, do you smoke? Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit. No, that's great.

I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though. Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often? I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so. OK, ok, I see, uhm, alright, and do you live alone or do you live with other people?

OK, alright, and are you able to take care of things like groceries or finances, or shoveling snow or cleaning the house, or do you need any assistance with those sort of household activities?

It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics? No, I haven't. And you don't have any allergies to any, correct? Correct.

Did you, were you, were you drunk and did you pass out? Yeah, I think so. My, my friends, uh yeah, that's what my friends were, were saying anyway. OK, and uh, talking about alcohol, how much do you usually drink? I usually, like, like four to six beers a day, but uh, yeah, yesterday was certainly more than that. Have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink? Has it affected you in any way? I mean I, I'm retired now so, uhm, I don't know, I, I feel like it's been fine maybe, uh, I feel like it's been fine. OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later. OK. And, uh, do you smoke? Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit. No, that's great.

He was a lifelong smoker and didn't really, didn't really take care of himself. Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor? Uh, I do. I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though. Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?

The patient is a non-smoker and has no significant past medical history. Upon physical examination, he appears pale and clammy, with a weak pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. His vital signs reveal a temperature of 98.5°F (36.9°C), a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and a systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg.

The patient's symptoms worsened over time, progressing from mild to moderate over several hours. He reports that his chest pain started as a sharp, stabbing sensation and radiated to his left arm, which then spread to his jaw and neck. The pain was accompanied by a feeling of impending doom or fear. The patient also reported experiencing nausea, dizziness, and fatigue.

Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was found to be unresponsive and had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Emergency department physicians performed a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, which revealed a large, irregularly-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant of the liver.

The patient underwent surgery for the removal of the tumor. Post-operative recovery was complicated by multiple organ failure, including acute kidney injury and respiratory failure. The patient developed sepsis and died six days after surgery.

The patient is a college student who works as a waitress at a local restaurant. She denies any recent travel history of exposure to animals or other potential sources of infection.

Physical examination reveals no abnormalities on initial assessment. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that her left shoulder is swollen and tender to palpation. There is also a small amount of blood on the skin overlying the affected area.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a mild increase in neutrophils, but normal platelet count. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, ranging from 101°F to 102°F (38°C to 39°C). Her vital signs are stable, and there is no evidence of respiratory distress or cardiovascular instability.

**Analysis**

This case highlights the importance of considering the patient's occupation and lifestyle factors when evaluating patients presenting with acute musculoskeletal pain. The patient's employment as a waitress may have exposed her to various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which could be contributing to her symptoms.

Family History:

* Father: Coronary Artery Disease
* Brother: Coronary Artery Disease

The patient is currently asymptomatic but has recently started taking statins to manage his cholesterol levels. He has no other significant medical conditions. What would be the most likely diagnosis?

**Analysis**

Based on the patient's symptoms and family history, it is highly suggestive that the patient may have a familial component to his condition. Given the presence of coronary artery disease in both his parents, it is possible that this patient may be at increased risk for developing coronary artery disease himself.

However, the patient's current asymptomatic status raises some concerns about whether he should undergo further testing or treatment. Statin therapy is typically recommended for individuals with established coronary artery disease, as it can help reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.

Considering the patient's lack of symptoms, it is reasonable to recommend that he undergo a stress test to evaluate his cardiac function and identify any potential areas of concern. This will allow us to determine if the patient is at risk for coronary artery disease and guide further management decisions.

**Recommendation**

1. Order a stress test to evaluate cardiac",3.2128514056224904,1.6096612059941844,4.255319148936171,80.1595151424408,83.12196731567383,81.61386251449585

OK. Any recent travel? Uh nope, I've been at home. OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you. Yeah, no worries.","<|begin_of_text|>What brings you in?

The patient is febrile and tachycardic (tachypnea). Vital signs reveal a temperature of 103°F, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Physical examination reveals bilateral carotid pulses are absent, but no other abnormalities are noted.

What would be the most likely diagnosis?

A) Acute myocardial infarction
B) Cardiogenic shock
C) Pulmonary embolism
D) Pneumonia
E) Pericarditis
F) Hypertension
G) Hyperthyroidism
H) Anemia

Explanation:

The correct answer can be determined by analyzing the symptoms presented by the patient. The presence of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, along with a high fever, chills, and nausea, suggests that the patient has an acute infection. The absence of sweating, diaphoresis, and tachycardia may indicate hypovolemia or dehydration, which could be due to the infection. The physical examination finding of absent carotid pulses further supports this suspicion. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pneumonia, as it is a common cause of acute infection leading to hypovolemic shock.",4.081632653061224,0.45750901087167767,4.6692607003891045,78.61867547035217,83.2438588142395,80.8651864528656

I'll have a glass of wine like once a week. OK, and do you use any recreational drugs? Um so I've I've been using cannabis oil for the past month just to see if it helps with the pain. OK, and has that been working for you at all? A little bit I think. OK. OK, so those are some of the questions I had. And I'm just gonna ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble. So along your back, if you if you were to press down on from the middle to your lower back, any kind of pain when you press down. Um lower back, yes. OK, So what kind of pain is it like sharp or is it kind of a dull aching pain? When I press down it feels sharp. OK, and do you have you notice any kind of swelling in your legs or, near the areas where you have pain swelling or redness, or any warmth? Um it seems to. Actually, no, it's not. It's not warm. OK.

OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all? Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for? Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI. OK And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there. OK, sounds good. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care.","<|begin_of_text|>What brings you in here today?

She reports that she has been experiencing this for several days and is unable to eat or drink anything except water. Her symptoms have worsened over time, and she is now showing signs of dehydration.

Key points:

* The patient's vital signs reveal a low blood pressure (90/60 mmHg) and a high heart rate (120 beats per minute).
* Physical examination reveals tenderness to percussion over the right upper quadrant of her abdomen.
* Laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes and a mild elevation in white blood cell count.
* Imaging studies reveal a mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, which appears to be solid and mobile on ultrasound.

Diagnosis:
The patient is diagnosed with acute appendicitis, likely due to a perforated appendix. The diagnosis is confirmed by imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI. The patient's condition requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent further complications and death.

Treatment:
The patient will require immediate surgery to remove the inflamed appendix. The procedure is typically performed laparoscopically, as it allows for faster recovery times and less post-operative pain compared to open surgery. The patient will also receive antibiotics to treat any potential infection and anti-emetics to manage nausea and vomiting.

Prognosis:
The prognosis for this patient is guarded, as the appendix can rupture if left untreated. However, with prompt treatment, the patient should make",1.2295081967213115,0.22493786949414332,1.444043321299639,78.4877359867096,82.78524875640869,80.57923913002014

The patient is a non-smoker and does not have a history of cardiovascular disease. She has no other significant medical conditions. Her husband reported that she was feeling increasingly anxious and irritable over the past week, which may be related to the chest pain.

The patient is being treated with aspirin and ibuprofen for her heart attack. What do you think is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Analysis: Based on the patient's presentation, it appears that the patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the presence of elevated troponin levels suggests that the patient may have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). Given the patient's age and lack of risk factors for ACS, it is possible that the MI was caused by a thrombosis rather than a rupture of a previously undiagnosed plaque.

He underwent a thorough examination and laboratory tests were conducted to diagnose the cause of his condition. The results showed that he has type 2 diabetes mellitus. His fasting plasma glucose level was found to be elevated at 180 mg/dL. This indicates that his body's cells are not using insulin effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels.

The patient's healthcare provider recommended that he undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis and monitor his condition. The patient's family members reported that they had noticed some symptoms such as frequent urination, blurred vision, and fatigue. These symptoms suggest that the patient may have diabetic nephropathy, which can lead to kidney damage if left untreated.

A comprehensive assessment of the patient's overall health revealed that he also has hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The patient's diet and exercise habits were evaluated, and it was determined that he consumes a relatively low-calorie diet and engages in regular physical activity. However, his sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits contribute to his weight gain.

The patient's healthcare team developed a personalized treatment plan to manage his diabetes, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and education on healthy eating habits. The patient was prescribed metformin, a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, and started taking it daily.

The patient reports that he has been experiencing these symptoms for several days and is now presenting with severe abdominal tenderness and guarding. The patient's vital signs reveal tachycardia, hypotension, and mild respiratory distress. The patient's history reveals that he has a history of smoking and substance abuse.

Initial Assessment:

* Vital Signs: Tachycardia (120 bpm), hypotension (90/60 mmHg), mild respiratory distress
* Physical Examination: Abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness
* Laboratory Results: Elevated white blood cell count (12,000 cells/mm^3) with a left shift, elevated liver enzymes, and normal kidney function tests

Diagnosis:

The patient's presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of acute appendicitis. However, the patient's history of smoking and substance abuse may be contributing factors to his condition. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated liver enzymes further support this suspicion. Additionally, the presence of abdominal tenderness and guarding on physical examination may indicate peritonitis, which can be caused by various conditions including appendicitis, pancreatitis, and other intra-abdominal infections.

Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns? Uh no, that sounds great, thank you. You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there. OK, sounds great thanks. You're welcome. Take care.

She reports that she has been experiencing some difficulty breathing and shortness of breath since her last menstrual period. The patient is a non-smoker and does not have any significant past medical history. She was admitted to the emergency department for evaluation.

Initial Assessment:

* Vital signs: Tachycardia (120 beats per minute), mild tachypnea (24 breaths per minute), and low blood pressure (90/60 mmHg).
* Physical examination reveals bilateral lung exam, but no abnormalities.
* Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (22,000 cells/mm^3) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are mildly elevated at 20 mg/dL.
* Chest X-ray shows a normal-sized left lower lobe consolidation without evidence of pneumonia or other lung pathology.

Diagnosis:

* The patient's symptoms suggest a possible viral infection, given the acute onset of fever, headache, and fatigue, as well as the elevated CRP levels.
* However, the lack of respiratory findings on physical examination and the absence of a clear source of infection on chest X-ray make it less likely that this is a bacterial infection.
* Further testing may be needed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Treatment:

* The patient will be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infections.
* The patient will also be advised to rest and avoid",7.079646017699115,3.0723814905702747,7.2992700729927,78.64077091217041,84.11220908164978,81.28451704978943

She reports that she has been experiencing these symptoms for several days. Her husband reported that she was acting strangely before her symptoms began, becoming increasingly irritable and agitated. The patient's vital signs reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response.

Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and disoriented, but no obvious injuries or trauma can be detected. The physical examination reveals tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, which may indicate peritonitis. Imaging studies confirm the presence of free air in the abdominal cavity, suggesting bowel perforation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. The patient's mental status remains stable, but she is unable to swallow saliva and has difficulty speaking due to dysphagia. 

A thorough history and physical examination have revealed a possible diagnosis of acute appendicitis, given the location of the tenderness and the timing of the onset of symptoms. However, further imaging studies are needed to confirm this diagnosis.

## Step 1: Initial Assessment
Upon initial assessment, it appears that this patient may be experiencing acute appendicitis, given the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. However, the presence of a significantly elevated WBC count and decreased appetite could suggest a more complex condition such as pancreatitis or another systemic illness.

* Physical examination reveals tenderness to percussion over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

Diagnosis:

* The patient is diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder.
* The diagnosis is further supported by imaging studies, including ultrasound and CT scan, which confirm the presence of a gallstone causing the obstruction of the cystic duct.
* The patient's symptoms suggest that the gallstone is likely causing a mechanical obstruction of the common bile duct, leading to jaundice and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.

His wife reports that he was recently diagnosed with a chronic condition called ""inflammatory arthritis"" which is causing him to lose weight and experience joint pain.

Family History:

* Mother: Sickle cell trait
* Father: Hypertension
* Sister: Type 2 diabetes
* Brother: Hypertension

Discussion:
The patient's presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), given his symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and weight loss. However, the presence of inflammatory arthritis is also consistent with other conditions such as lupus or psoriasis. The patient's family history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes may be relevant in considering these diagnoses, but they do not directly relate to the current clinical presentation. The patient's age and sex are typical for RA, but the lack of other systemic features such as fever, rash, or lymphadenopathy makes it less likely. The patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a localized disease process rather than a systemic one. Further diagnostic testing would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of his symptoms. 

Recommendation:
Based on this case, further diagnostic testing should be performed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. This may include blood tests to check for inflammation markers, imaging studies to evaluate joint damage, and possibly genetic testing to identify potential genetic predis",2.0920502092050204,0.29648148221150106,2.973977695167286,78.89475226402283,81.37048482894897,80.11349439620972

She was discharged home on post-operative day one, but developed severe abdominal pain and vomiting within 24 hours after surgery. The patient's symptoms worsened over time, with increasing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness.

The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated to the point where she required hospitalization for several days due to dehydration and shock. Despite receiving intravenous fluids and antibiotics, her condition did not improve. She eventually required surgical intervention to repair a perforated intestine, which led to further complications.

The patient's condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment, and she became increasingly unstable. She was eventually transferred to a tertiary care center for further management. At that institution, she received additional treatments including bowel rest, nutritional support, and pain management.

Despite these interventions, the patient remained critically ill and eventually succumbed to sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by an imbalance of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria in the body.

I knew something was not right and something was broken. When did this happen? Just uh I would say like an hour ago Hour ago, OK. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all? No, not really. I I had to come in the ambulance. OK, OK, and um if you were to localize this pain, where exactly is it? It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful, but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg. The middle part, OK middle part of your lower leg, so kind of where your shins are? Mhmm. OK, so in the shin area, OK. Um have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour. Uh no nothing. I just like I just want to make sure I keep it as still as possible um I didn't wanna even try anything. OK yeah, that makes sense, if you were to describe this pain, would you say it's um sharp, dull, achy throbbing? It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life. OK, OK. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is it? At 10 for sure. Ten, OK, have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, um do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better? Uh I would say it's the same, it's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier. OK. OK and um so yeah, OK, um do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms? Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension. Um but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down. OK, OK. Um otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere in your body? No. How about any numbness or tingling in the area? Um I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, um but it like comes and goes. OK um and then how about how about any um like feelings of like losing sensation or feeling cold in that area? Um no, I I can feel everything in that area. OK. But it's hard to tell like it's just very painful right now. OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um how about headaches? No, no headaches. Uh any fainting or dizziness. No. Um confusion or memory loss? No. Um weight loss recently. No. Fevers or chills? No. Uh changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes? No, nothing that I've noticed. No, any changes to your vision, hearing, smell, or taste? No. Um how about coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing? No, no, nothing like that. No, OK, um how about chest pain or palpitations? No. No, any changes to your bowel movements? Uh no, not that I've noticed. Uh nausea or vomiting? Nope. Abdominal pain? No. Changes to urinary habits? No, nothing like that. No, OK, um and are you otherwise healthy? Yeah, I've been pretty healthy, I um don't take any medications regularly, I don't have any medical conditions. OK, that's good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? No, um just just for like my pregnancies, I had two pregnancies, both of them delivered vaginally, but no issues with that, just after that no hospitalizations or surgeries. OK, OK. Um and then um are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yep. OK, that's good. Um do you have any allergies? No, not that I know of. OK, um and then is there any family history of like musculoskeletal issues? Um so my mother has something called osteoporosis. OK, yep. Um but that's that's all that I can think of. How old was she when she was diagnosed with that? Um probably in her fifties. In her fifties, OK. Late fifties I would say. Um have you been, have you ever like been tested for that? No, I've never, I've never had testing. OK, all right. Um and then any family history of lung or heart conditions? No. Uh how about autoimmune conditions? Uh no, not that I know of. Any cancers? Uh, I think one of my aunts has uh ovarian cancer. OK, OK, um how old was she when she was diagnosed with that? Um like pretty uh recently, so probably like in her sixties. OK, OK, um and then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently? No. No, OK, have you done any travel recently? No. OK. Um those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component? No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible. OK, that sounds good, yeah we'll, we'll try our best. Thank you. Um OK, so now looking at your legs like side by side, do you notice any uh redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left? Yeah, it's all, it's all swollen and red and just looks so much different than my other leg. OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin? No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken. OK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin? No. No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area? Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry. OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area? No. No, OK, and then uh placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer? Yeah, I feel like it's it's warmer. OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees? No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try. OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg? No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible. OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK? That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much. OK, yeah, no worries.","<|begin_of_text|>What brings you in?

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His wife reports that he was seen by a cardiologist for chest pain several months prior to presenting to the ER.

The patient's vital signs reveal tachycardia, mild hypotension, and a non-tender abdomen. Physical examination reveals tenderness overlying the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. 

A CT scan of the abdomen reveals a large mass in the left suprapubic area with multiple small nodules scattered throughout the pelvis. The mass appears to be composed of cystic structures with a thin wall and a smooth surface. The surrounding tissue appears normal. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a lymphocytic predominance, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's ESR is mildly elevated, suggesting some degree of inflammation. 

The patient's family members report that they have been experiencing similar symptoms for several years, including fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes.

"Would you mind by starting with what brought you in today? Yeah, so I'm just coming in with my son. He's six years old and yeah, just over the last few days he's not been himself and he's been having this stomach ache. Uh, so it started around like I would say 3 days ago and then he's also having vomiting for the last two days, he's vomited in total six times over the last two days and then yesterday he also developed a fever as well. I managed to measure it and it was 38.3 degrees Celsius. OK, I see. So I just so that I understand the timeline, so he started to have abdominal pain about 3 days ago, started with having vomiting and diarrhea two days ago and you checked his temperature, he had a fever as of yesterday? Yeah. OK, and uh, was there anything that that he ate that was different over over these last few days? No, we've been strictly home food during like a pandemic like no, no real changes. OK, and what's his kind of behavior been like over these last couple of days?

OK, I see and uh, could you describe the vomit? Yes, so vomit like, it started two days ago. The first day it was just like he puked up the things that he had eaten, but yesterday it was it was mainly just like uh just yellowish material, I couldn't really tell if it was food or not. OK, have you noticed any bile or blood in the vomit? Uh no I didn't notice any blood and I didn't notice any green material. It was mainly just like like normal vomit, like yellowish color. OK, I see and, has the what was the vomiting triggered by anything that you're aware of, like eating or drinking? Uhm? Yeah, two days ago it was it was after after lunch when he first vomited. But after that it's just been kind of random. I see OK, and, uh, and with regards to his diarrhea, has there been any any blood or or any color changes? No, no, I didn't notice any blood at all. It's definitely just very very watery and he's had to go probably even just in the last day, probably around like six or seven times. OK, um, and he's vomited how many times? So in total I can count 6 times. OK, and, has he been complaining of any headaches at all? No, not that I know. No. OK, and how about any ear pain or or eye pain? No, not that he's mentioned to me.

Any chest pain? Um, he did, he did point to his stomach like it seems like he was having with all the vomiting like, he was having some stomach pain as well. OK, is there any specific location that that he's feeling the pain? Well, it's hard to say. He was just pointing at the center of his belly like, I don't know if it's like, I tried pressing on it and he didn't feel any pain then, but I think it's just kind of all over his stomach. OK, and has he had any urinary problems like painful voiding or been peeing more often? No, that's been OK. Have you noticed any rashes or skin changes? Uh, no, not not really, no. OK. And has he had any muscle aches or uh, or joint pains that that he's mentioned? No, no he hasn't mentioned anything like that. OK, and he's had a fever, has he had the chills? Yeah, so that's that's what I, that prompted me to take his temperature yesterday around the afternoon, like we had to wrap him up with like more than two blankets and he was still feeling cold so, yeah, definitely was having chills. OK, and and has there been any concerns with his growth, either weight or or height? So he's been going along the charts pretty well, like no concerns during his growth. Otherwise, he's a very healthy child. OK, so no medical diagnosis previously? No nothing like that. OK, and uh, yeah, is he meeting all developmental milestones OK? Like gross motor, fine motor, doing well at school? Yeah yeah, he didn't have any issues with walking, running, he's pretty social with all his peers. He's doing well at school, no complaints. OK, excellent and you know, no medical conditions, but has there been any reasons for being in the hospital before? No, not at all. We, yeah, we haven't really gone to the doctor with him after like all those vaccinations that he had to do, so he's been good. OK, great, so immunizations are up to date? Yeah, immunizations all up to date. Excellent and does he have any allergies? Uh, no, uh, not not anything that we know of yet. OK, and I just wanted to ask about his birth history. Were there any complications throughout throughout pregnancy, either mom being sick or having any any issues herself? No, so it was a normal vaginal delivery, uh no issues, uh he was born at 39 weeks, didn't need to stay in the hospital at all. Yeah, it was a pretty smooth pregnancy compared to some of the other ones. OK, oh, that's that's great. Do you remember the Apgar score or his birth weight? Uhm, I don't exactly remember his Apgar scores, I think they were like just just they they were normal like there was nothing concerning about them, and birth weight I think he was probably around 3 kilograms. OK, great so, yeah healthy birth weight at term it sounds like. And so, healthy, does he take any medications regularly? No, no medications. OK, and could you tell me about who is living with currently and then who's looking after him? Yeah, so he's living with myself, his mother and, and then my husband, and he has two older siblings. One is a boy, seven years old, and another one like a 10 year old girl. OK, and has anybody in the house been sick? Uh no, no one has been sick recently, however he does, they did let them go back into school at one point, so I don't know, I don't know, so that was just last week, so I don't know if he caught something from school. OK, but nobody that you know that's had similar symptoms? No. OK, and have you traveled anywhere? No, we've been, we've been at home. OK, uh, and then you know recent changes to anything in the diet you've mentioned? No, that's been fine. OK, and any concerns for safety in the home, whether physical or or verbal abuse? No, no concerns like that. OK, yeah a question that we have to ask everybody and is there any smoking in the home? No, no, we don't smoke. OK, great then, are there any pets? Nope, no pets. Alright, and uh and in the family, has there been anybody who's had any heart problems or any lung problems? Uh, we are getting the 10 year old tested for just uh, asthma. OK.

OK, uh, anybody in the family have celiac disease or Crohn's disease? No, no, uh no history of any kind of bowel diseases. OK, so I think that's, uh, everything I want I wanted to ask about today. Uh, was there anything that maybe I I forgot to ask or or that I missed that you wanted to tell me? Uh, yeah, no it's, it's also just like I was just reading up like, can it be like I don't know if it can be COVID as well, if it can, it can do this as well? It is possible. Uh, it's uh, especially with nonspecific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations, and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain. But it also could be well, uh, another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will, I will go ahead and do a COVID test today, along with some other blood work. And maybe increase the hydration as well, because it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we will check electrolytes and go from there on the test results. Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.","<|begin_of_text|>Would you mind by starting with what brought you in today? Yeah, so I'm just coming in with my son.

She reports that she has been experiencing these symptoms for several days prior to her visit. Her doctor prescribed her albuterol inhaler as a first-line treatment for her asthma.

The patient's symptoms worsened over time, and she was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Upon arrival, she was found to have a severe asthma exacerbation, characterized by high levels of eosinophils in her sputum and blood tests revealed elevated levels of interleukin-5 (IL-5) and other inflammatory markers. The patient's symptoms were exacerbated by exposure to allergens such as dust mites and mold.

The patient's condition is now being managed with a combination of medications, including oral corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and immunomodulators. However, the patient's symptoms persist despite this treatment. Further investigation reveals that the patient's asthma is likely caused by an allergic reaction to a specific food ingredient in her diet.

The patient's symptoms worsen when she consumes foods containing wheat gluten, particularly bread products. This suggests that the patient's asthma may be triggered by a non-allergic mechanism, rather than an allergic one. The patient's immune system responds to wheat gluten by releasing histamine, which causes her symptoms to worsen.

Medical History:

* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Smoking (heavy)
* Recent onset of chest pain and shortness of breath

Physical Examination:

* Vital signs: BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 100 bpm, RR 24/min, SpO2 92% on room air

* ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF
* Troponin levels are elevated at 1.5 ng/mL
* Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly

Management:

* Initial treatment includes oxygen therapy and antiplatelet therapy
* Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the chest pain and shortness of breath

Discussion:

The patient's presentation suggests acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is confirmed by the ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in multiple leads. The troponin levels confirm the diagnosis.

She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough. I see, OK. When did the fever and cough start? So they started around three to four days ago. And around the same time she was also having like a runny nose. OK, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time? Uh, yeah I would say they started around the same time and ah, they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days. OK, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough? Uh no, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed. OK, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms? Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me. OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same? I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like, especially today, but the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago. OK. Has she been sick like this before? She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was OK, um, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever? Uh Tylenol, I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back, uhm say like a few hours later. OK, and anything you notice that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days? Not anything that I know of. Her fevers been getting worse, but I don't really know why that is. OK, uh, has she been having any other symptoms? Um, other than like, yeah, she had that runny nose when it first started, and then she's also been having some diarrhea. OK, and when did the diarrhea start? I think I would say it started around two days ago. She's, like every time I change her diaper she would have like 4-5 different diaper changes throughout the day, and they they seem pretty liquid. So I OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour? Consistency, I'd say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and colour I didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour. OK. So you didn't think there was any blood in the stool? No, no, no, I didn't see any blood. OK, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it? So I used, we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit. OK. Uh, did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear? No, no, she doesn't seem to have any irritation there. OK, uh, how about any vomiting or regurgitation? No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there. OK, and notice any discharge from either eye? Uh, no. How about any discharge from ears? Not that I've noticed, no. Notice any rashes? Uh, no, I didn't not know like new rashes, no.

OK, would you say inconsolable at times? Sometimes like yesterday like she, I couldn't get her to stop crying. OK and uh, I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum? Yeah, I would say, uh, this green slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy. OK, um, how much would you say, uhm, like a cup, or more? I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time, she would cough up. OK, and did you notice any blood in it? No, I didn't notice any blood at all. OK, and with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing? Uh, I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths. I see, OK. Uh, is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking? Uh, no. I haven't noticed that. OK, and does her voice sound normal to you? Yeah, I think her note, her voice hasn't really changed that much. OK, um, with the noticing the faster rate of breathing is the breathing noisy at all? Uh, no, like she's not wheezing or anything. OK, and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing. Uh so like, uhm, like what do you mean by that? Like just so when she's breathing in and out. Is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs. Uh no, I I don't think I've noticed that, no. OK. And, and, have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth? Uh, no. OK, and any urinary problems? Uh, no, she's peeing fine. OK. And how has she been sleeping the last few days? She hasn't really been sleeping in between the crying and like just being so irritable. I think she's just very uncomfortable when she's trying to get to sleep, so OK. Any evidence of seizure or limb jerking? Uh no, not that I've noticed. No, OK. And and have you notice an her being like really lethargic at all? Uh, she's not herself and she's still like pretty active, like she's, she just seems really unhappy and irritated. But no, she still has energy. OK. And uh, is she drinking yeah, a lot more fluids or or a lot less? How is she tolerating oral intake? I would say I think she's more on the dryer side like she, her mouth is very dry. Her lips are like all cracked, and she it seems that she's drinking I see, OK. And, uh, how many wet diapers would you say in the last 24 hours? Um? Yeah, it's difficult to say.

Thank you.","<|begin_of_text|>Hi there, I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today. I am just calling about my daughter. She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough. I see, OK. When did the fever and cough start? So they started around three to four days ago. And around the same time she was also having like a runny nose. OK, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time? Uh, yeah I would say they started around the same time and ah, they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days. OK, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough? Uh no, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed. OK, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms? Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me. OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same? I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like, especially today, but the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago. OK. Has she been sick like this before? She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was OK, um, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever? Uh Tylenol, I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back, uhm say like a few hours later. OK, and anything you notice that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days? Not anything that I know of. Her fevers been getting worse, but I don't really know why that is. OK, uh, has she been having any other symptoms? Um, other than like, yeah, she had that runny nose when it first started, and then she's also been having some diarrhea. OK, and when did the diarrhea start? I think I would say it started around two days ago. She's, like every time I change her diaper she would have like 4-5 different diaper changes throughout the day, and they they seem pretty liquid. So I OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour? Consistency, I'd say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and colour I didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour. OK. So you didn't think there was any blood in the stool? No, no, no, I didn't see any blood. OK, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it? So I used, we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit. OK. Uh, did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear? No, no, she doesn't seem to have any irritation there. OK, uh, how about any vomiting or regurgitation? No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there. OK, and notice any discharge from either eye? Uh, no. How about any discharge from ears? Not that I've noticed, no. Notice any rashes? Uh, no, I didn't not know like new rashes, no. OK and how is she been in terms of mood or or behaviour? Oh she's been pretty like she's not herself over the last few days. She's been crying a lot more, just very irritable. OK, would you say inconsolable at times? Sometimes like yesterday like she, I couldn't get her to stop crying. OK and uh, I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum? Yeah, I would say, uh, this green slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy. OK, um, how much would you say, uhm, like a cup, or more? I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time, she would cough up. OK, and did you notice any blood in it? No, I didn't notice any blood at all. OK, and with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing? Uh, I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths. I see, OK. Uh, is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking? Uh, no. I haven't noticed that. OK, and does her voice sound normal to you? Yeah, I think her note, her voice hasn't really changed that much. OK, um, with the noticing the faster rate of breathing is the breathing noisy at all? Uh, no, like she's not wheezing or anything. OK, and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing. Uh so like, uhm, like what do you mean by that? Like just so when she's breathing in and out. Is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs. Uh no, I I don't think I've noticed that, no. OK. And, and, have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth? Uh, no. OK, and any urinary problems? Uh, no, she's peeing fine. OK. And how has she been sleeping the last few days? She hasn't really been sleeping in between the crying and like just being so irritable. I think she's just very uncomfortable when she's trying to get to sleep, so OK. Any evidence of seizure or limb jerking? Uh no, not that I've noticed. No, OK. And and have you notice an her being like really lethargic at all? Uh, she's not herself and she's still like pretty active, like she's, she just seems really unhappy and irritated. But no, she still has energy. OK. And uh, is she drinking yeah, a lot more fluids or or a lot less? How is she tolerating oral intake? I would say I think she's more on the dryer side like she, her mouth is very dry. Her lips are like all cracked, and she it seems that she's drinking I see, OK. And, uh, how many wet diapers would you say in the last 24 hours? Um? Yeah, it's difficult to say. I think I like yesterday changed four to five times. They were all diarrhea, so not really sure, but maybe around 5. OK, and have you guys traveled anywhere recently? No. No, we've been here. OK, so next just some questions about past medical history. Uh, has she had any medical problems in the past?

He is experiencing difficulty breathing and has a history of asthma. His temperature is elevated at 103°F (39.4°C). The patient's lungs are clear on auscultation, but he reports that his chest is tight and tender to palpation.

What would be your next steps?

1. What type of pneumonia?
2. Which antibiotics should be administered?
3. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
4. What is the treatment plan for this patient?

Answer:

**Step 1:** Based on the patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fever, and difficulty breathing, as well as his history of asthma, the most likely diagnosis is **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**.

**Step 2:** Given the patient's severe respiratory distress and elevated temperature, the first-line antibiotic therapy for ARDS is **meropenem** or **vancomycin**, which cover both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, given the patient's asthma history, **tetracycline** may also be considered as an alternative option.

**Step 3:** The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)** due to **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) complicated by acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.

OK, and uh, any cancers that run in the family? Not that I know of. OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there. OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all? I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened. OK, alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.","<|begin_of_text|>What brought you in today? Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned. OK, I see. When did the chest pain start? So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago. OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of? No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain.

Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away? Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in. OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better? Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it. OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down? Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think. OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on? Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow. I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before? No, never. OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches? No. How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough?

No. OK, and have you had any muscle aches, joint pains or skin changes? No. OK, and uhm, in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? No, I've been pretty healthy. OK, so do you take any medications regularly? No, nothing at all. And do you have any allergies? No, no allergies. Any hospitalizations in the past or any surgeries?

Plan:
- (No plan provided.)","A 35-year-old male patient presents with symptoms of acute onset of severe headache, fever, and stiff neck, which began after a recent change in his work schedule. He reports no other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or fatigue. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no history of chronic diseases.

**Initial Assessment**

* Vital signs: Tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm), mild tachypnea (respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute)
* Physical examination: 
	+ Headache
	+ Fever
	+ Stiff neck
	+ Mild cervical spine tenderness
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): Normal
	+ Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP): Normal
	+ Electrolyte panel: Normal
	+ Urinalysis: Negative for blood and protein
* Imaging studies:
	+ CT scan of the head: Suggestive of a subdural hematoma
	+ MRI of the brain: No evidence of hemorrhage or edema

**Diagnosis**

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a subdural hematoma due to a traumatic injury. The patient's symptoms suggest a possible epidural hematoma, but the absence of significant neurological deficits and the presence of a subdural hematoma make this less likely. However, it is essential to consider alternative diagnoses, including epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, and mening",1.0152284263959392,0.22759035281327372,1.8181818181818181,76.72969102859497,82.09784626960754,79.32304739952087

The patient's history is notable for no prior episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath, which raises concern for alternative causes such as pulmonary embolism or cardiac arrhythmia. The patient's lack of previous MI history also suggests that this may be a TIA rather than a full-blown MI. However, the absence of chest pain and shortness of breath makes it less likely. A thorough physical examination reveals no abnormalities, but the patient's symptoms suggest a possible cardiac cause. Further investigation is warranted to rule out other potential causes.

"I was wondering if we could start with you telling us what brought you in? Sure, I've had this terrible headache for the past four days. Doesn't seem to be getting any better, and I feel hot like I have a fever. I've been coughing a lot so I am I'm worried I have COVID, so I'm here. OK. So I'll start with the headaches. When did when did that exactly started? Uh the headache started, OK so the coughing started four days ago. The headache started shortly after so I would say later on during that day and then the fever I've had for, fever I think I've had for the past two days. I haven't actually taken my temperature though. OK um. So, uh, the cough is started four days ago. Has the cough gotten better, worse, or stayed the same? The cough has stayed the same. OK, are you bringing up any phlegm or sputum with the cough? Um, it's not really phlegm, but sometimes I cough up, like bits of like. You know little bits that look like blood or something. OK, so you're seeing some like red when when you're coughing up? Mmmm OK, and how much of this are you seeing like, is it like a teaspoon amount or or more? Oh, it's it's very little. It's like maybe a little bit bigger than like the tip of a pencil. Oh OK, are you, OK, are you seeing this on like kind of tissues afterwards sort of thing? Yeah. OK, um and any triggers for the cough you can think of? No, it just seems to be there all day. Um, doesn't really get better with me trying to rest or not. OK, and is the cough there at night time too? Yes, it is definitely there at night. OK, um is it interfering with sleep? Ah yes, I haven't been sleeping well. OK, um, and with your cough have you had any difficulties with breathing? Um, no. Alright, and now, how about any wheezing? No wheezing. OK. And with this headache when it first came on, did you experience a like worst headache of your life, or a Thunder clap sensation? No, it's it's not that bad, but it just seems to be there all day long. OK, um have you had headaches like this before? No, I've never gotten headaches in the past. OK, uh is the headache associated with any nausea or vomiting? No. OK, and is the headache worse in the morning when you first wake up? No. OK, and does it have to get worse if you lie flat? No. OK, and has this headache been getting worse, staying the same, getting better? It's it's about the same. OK. Um and, um and you haven't checked the temperature yet, you said, but you felt hot? Yes, that's right. OK, any other symptoms that you've been experiencing? Not that I can think of. OK, there's just a few others that I wanted to ask about to be comprehensive. Have you had any eye pain or ear pain? No. How about any discharge from either your eyes or ears? No, nothing like that. Alright, have you had any changes to either your sense of smell or your sense of taste? No. Alright, and have you had a runny nose at all? Um no. And how about a sore throat? No. OK, and um, have you had any chills? Um no chills. How about night sweats? Um no nothing like that. I see, OK and over the last few months has your weight changed? Ah no, not that I noticed. OK, um have you been feeling tired or fatigued? No. OK, and have you had any chest pain? Um no. Alright, and how about any heart palpitations? None.

And have you had any abdominal pain? Um no, no abdominal pain. Any diarrhea or constipation? No. How about any painful urination or feeling as though you need to urinate really frequently? Ah no nothing like that. OK, and have you had any skin changes like rashes or anything like that? No. OK, and how about any muscle aches or joint aches or just overall like body pains? Mmm no, not that I that not. Not that I've noticed, no. OK, is there anything in regards to your past health that you see a physician regularly for? Um No. Ah actually I I think at one point, um, I was worked up for something called familial hypercholesterolemia because it ran in the family. But I think those results were normal. OK, so do you, um, do you take a statin medication then? Yeah I take a low dose statin. OK, and when was your last lipid panel checked? I think it was two years ago. I see, and um do you remember if the LDL was normal at that time? Ah yes it was normal. OK, but since the, it was about two years ago, it might be worthwhile today just to also check a lipid panel just to be safe, but that'll be something we can talk about that more so at the end if that's OK. Sure, yeah, that would be great. OK, and any other medical conditions? No. OK. Have you had any surgeries before? C-section. How many children do you have? Ah just the one. OK, and were there any complications with the c-section? Um no no complications. OK, any reasons for hospitalizations? Nope. OK, any allergies to medications? No. Alright, any medications besides the statin that you take? Nope. OK, and in regards to your family history, have there been people who've had early heart attacks or strokes in the family? No. OK, but you do have familial hypercholesterolemia, do you have family members who have that? Yes OK so my Aunts had it, as well as my mother. OK um. And has there been any lung conditions that run in the family? Um, no lung conditions. How about any malignancy's or or cancers? Ah there was colon cancer on my dad side of the family, but I'm not too sure who had it. OK, have you heard of anybody having breast cancer? Breast cancer no. Alright, and how about ovarian cancer? No ovarian cancer. OK. And next I actually wanted to ask a few questions about your personal and lifestyle habits, but first, could you just tell me a little bit about your living situation right now? I live with my husband and my one son. OK, and sorry, how old is your son? He is 10. OK, um is anybody in the home been sick recently? No. OK, and how about is there anybody at work? At work no. No one's been sick. OK, have you traveled anywhere recently? We went up to we just went to um like a, we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we weren't wearing masks, but we, it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern. OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike? Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that. I see OK. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. Um, do you smoke marijuana? Um no. OK, and do you drink alcohol? I don't. Do you use any other recreational drugs? Um no. OK, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Oh, actually one thing that I I did want to, I forgot to ask was, do you have any neck stiffness? No, not that I noticed. OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot? No, I think you covered it all. I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else? Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations. OK great, thank you. Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started. OK, sounds great.","<|begin_of_text|>I was wondering if we could start with you telling us what brought you in?

"How may I help you? I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder. OK and when, when did this pain start? It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week. OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either. OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away. I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week. OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back? It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder. OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key? It's more achy. OK. But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp. OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse? Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts. OK, and have you done anything that's made it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder. OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then. Yeah. OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10. Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now. OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder? Mmmm OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder? Um no not that I know of. OK, have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK, have you had any skin rashes or or skin changes? No. OK so even over the area you haven't noticed any redness or like soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK, how about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK, have you had pains and any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK And. Um, Have you had any recent infections or or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting? Um nope. OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side. OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night? Yup. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm? Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell. OK, And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back? It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up. OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased? Mmm OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling? No, I haven't felt any of that. OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea? Nope, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? Nope. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago. OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK, do you take any medications regularly? Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it. OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with, and whereabouts? Yeah, so I'm living with with my wife in a small condominium in downtown. OK, and are you working currently? Yeah, I'm working as a real estate agent. OK, uh, and do you drink alcohol? Rarely just on some occasions, but not regularly. No. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis? No, I've never smoked. Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past? Nope OK. Um. And so so the next part, just for the physical exam. So do you have pain with shoulder AB duction. Uhm yes. So just to yeah, I do have some pain. Especially from. Yeah yeah pain throughout AB duction. OK, is there any like pain that's like parts of that that range of motion that are more painful for you? yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees is more painful. OK. And. If your arm is outstretched and your thumb pointing down so your arm is internally rotated does that give you pain? Yeah, if yeah, not not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it it the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain. OK. OK, so it sounds like a positive jobes test and a positive Neer's test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation? Uh. Just to, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder there is some some pain over with palpation. OK, that sensation is normal, reflexes are normal and strength is slightly reduced as well. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I maybe forgot? No, I think that's it. OK, um so based onI know that the symptoms today along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having a rotator cuff tear or um a rotator cuff impingement syndrome and where there is inflammation there not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So, uh, those would be the two most likely things. Yeah, their rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we were going to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging such as an X Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder. OK, sounds good. Thank you.","<|begin_of_text|>How may I help you?

"So what brings you in? Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned. Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four? Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time. OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm? Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material. White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes? It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat. OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled? I would say it's harsh. Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to? Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well. OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this? No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly. OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing? Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine. You're fine now, OK, uh, alright. And sorry, forgot to ask you earlier, do you see any blood in your phlegm? No, no, I haven't noticed any blood. OK, any uh changes to your hair or on your skin, like rashes? Not that I've noticed, no. OK, any weight loss? Um, I don't think so. OK, fevers? No. OK, exhaustion?

Uh no, not really. No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste? Uh nope. No, OK. Uh chest pain? Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest. Oh, yeah. But it tends to go away with uh just some rest. Oh OK, OK. Um how about palpitations? Like feeling like your heart is racing? Uh no, I don't think so. No, OK. How about some swelling in your limbs? I I did notice, like uh a little bit of swelling in my uh both my, like right by my ankles. My shoes, like like even when I wear my socks, it like leaves little marks and then uh I just feel my like my shoes are tighter. OK, OK and how long has that been going on? Probably, uh, I've had this issue for like a pretty long time um, probably I would say the last year at least. OK, OK, last year. Um any uh dizziness or fainting spells? No. No, OK, any memory issues, uh confusion? No. Numbness or tingling? No, nothing like that. No headaches? Uh no, no headaches. Changes to your bowel movements? No, I tend to go like once a day. And yeah, it's pretty normal. OK, uh nausea or vomiting? No. No, OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding conditions? I know you said you have COPD, anything else? I do have high blood pressure. OK. Do you have something called congestive heart failure? Uh no, what's that? OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs. Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that. I just thought that was uh, it's been going on for a while now and didn't really bother me too much. OK. Um alright, and are you taking any medications? Yeah, I have this medication uh right now I'm taking it, it's called lisinopril. OK, so that's for your blood pressure? Yeah. OK. Are you on any puffers? Sorry, go ahead. Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer. Yeah. And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva. OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits? Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help. OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though? Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective. OK, yeah. Um OK. And have you had any recent blood work done? Uh, no, I haven't been to the doctor for a while. OK. And do you have any allergies? Um I think I have allergies to uh like um amoxicillin, I got like a rash once. OK. Have you had any, uh, amoxicillin, or like penicillin type antibiotics recently? No. No, OK. Um are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yep. OK. Um, you're not quite at this age range yet, but uh we do recommend the pneumococcal vaccine when you turn 65. And um did you get the flu vaccine this year? Uh yeah I did, with the pandemic going on, I usually don't get it, but I got it this year. OK, good good. Um any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions? Uhm, lung conditions I don't think so. Heart conditions, uh my father did have a heart attack in his 60s, but he's fine. He's he's living right now. OK OK, any cancers? Cancers, I think my uncle from my father's side um had uh bladder cancer. OK, OK. Um do you smoke? I used to smoke. Um I just quit a few years ago. OK, congrats. Um how much did you used to smoke? Uhm, I don't know, probably I went through a like a whole pack every day, I would say for at least 30 years of my life. OK, OK um so it's good that you stopped. Um do you take any other recreational drugs? Uh no, nothing like that. No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink? Uh I drink every like, maybe a beer a day. OK. Um are you um living with anyone right now? Yeah, it's just uh me and my wife. OK, where do you guys live? Uh we just live uh outside of the city in in a condominium. OK, any uh old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos, anything like that in the condo? No, it's pretty well maintained. OK, good. And have you been in contact with any anyone sick recently? No, I've mainly just been trying to stay inside. I work from home too, so haven't really been seeing anyone. OK, that's good. And um travel to anywhere recently? Outside the province? Uhm, outside of the province, no, not not for like the last year at least. OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be. Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound? OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test. OK, sounds good. Yeah, no problem.","<|begin_of_text|>So what brings you in?

She reports that she has been experiencing symptoms of hay fever and asthma, which have worsened over time. She is also concerned about her recent diagnosis of cervical dysplasia. The patient's primary concern is whether she should undergo further testing or treatment for her cervical dysplasia.

**Key Points**

* **Symptoms**: Hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma
* **Medical History**: Cervical dysplasia
* **Current Concerns**: Follow-up on cervical dysplasia diagnosis

**Assessment**

The patient's symptoms suggest that she may be experiencing some level of respiratory distress due to her allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, the presence of cervical dysplasia raises concerns about potential long-term health implications. Further evaluation is warranted to determine if there is a link between the two conditions.

**Recommendations**

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is recommended that she undergo further testing to rule out any underlying causes of her respiratory distress. This may include:

* Chest X-ray to evaluate lung function and detect any abnormalities
* Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to assess lung capacity and function
* Endoscopy to examine the cervix for any signs of abnormal cell growth

It is essential to note that while cervical dysplasia can be a precursor to cancer, the risk is relatively low. However, further evaluation is necessary to determine",11.210762331838566,7.106259875820492,11.25,82.04386234283447,85.40241122245789,83.68945121765137

1. What type of imaging studies should I order?
2. What diagnostic tests should I perform to confirm the cause of her symptoms?
3. What is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and history?
4. What are the potential complications associated with this condition?
5. What treatment options are available for this condition?
6. How can we manage the patient's symptoms and prevent future episodes?

Answer:

**Step 1:** Imaging studies
I would recommend ordering a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen to evaluate for possible causes such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other abdominal emergencies. Additionally, I would consider ordering a barium enema to assess the colon for possible issues like constipation or diverticulosis.

Um do you experience any shortness of breath with this cough? No. No, OK. Is it a dry cough or do you bring up any phlegm? No, it's a dry cough. OK, uh any blood that you've seen? No, no. No, OK.

But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril. Sure.

The dog had been vaccinated and healthy before the incident. The dog's bite caused a V-shaped laceration on the patient's leg, which appears to be a result of the dog's sharp canine teeth penetrating the skin.
