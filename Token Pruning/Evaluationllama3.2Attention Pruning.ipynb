       "\"The patient was admitted to the hospital for elective repair of a ventral hernia. He was taken to the operating room where he underwent a ventral hernia repair with mesh overlay and lysis of adhesion. A thoracic epidural catheter was placed prior to the procedure for pain management. The operative course was stable with minimal blood loss. The patient was extubated after the procedure and monitored in the recovery room. His post-operative course was stable. The patient resumed a regular diet on the operative day. His foley catheter was removed on POD #1 and the patient voided without difficulty. He was transitioned from intravenous analgesia to an oral pain regimen and his epidural catheter was removed. He was reported to have a white blood cell count of 20 on POD #1. The patient's hemodynamic status remained stable and there were no signs of wound infection. On POD #2, his white blood cell count remained elevated to 22 and he underwent a chest x-ray which revealed a right-sided consolidation. Clindamycin was started for presumed pneumonia. One POD #3 the patient's leukocytosis decreased to 14 and normalized on POD #4. He did have mild blanching erythema surrounding the midline abdominal incision with minimal tenderness and no notable drainage or fluctuance. This remained stable without expansion from POD#2 - POD#4. The patient's vital signs remained stable and he afebrile. He was tolerating a regular diet and resumed his home medication. The patient was discharged home on POD #4 in stable condition. He was given a prescription for a 10-day course of clindamycin. An appointment for follow-up was made with the acute care service and with his primary care provider. \""
