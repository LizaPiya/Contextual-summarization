Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. ","Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed ""hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm"" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is > maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic).

Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6. Mild splenomegaly. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Atorvastatin 80 mg PO QPM 2. BuPROPion XL (Once Daily) 150 mg PO BID 3.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h.
