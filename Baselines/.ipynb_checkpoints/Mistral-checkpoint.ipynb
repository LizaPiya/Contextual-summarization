In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection and you were treated with antibiotics. You had an MRI of your head which did not show signs of a new stroke. You also had a bone biopsy of your skull which did not show signs of an infection. You had EEGs to monitor for seizures which did not show any seizure activity, but you were started on a new anti-seizure medicine. You had a PET body scan which showed infection of the prostate. You will likely need a prolonged course of antibiotics (about 12 weeks). Please follow up with your appointments listed below. You will need to follow up with heme/onc, infectious disease, neurology, and neurosurgery. Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. Sincerely, Your ___ Team \n"
