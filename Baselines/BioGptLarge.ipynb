Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6. Mild splenomegaly. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Atorvastatin 80 mg PO QPM 2. BuPROPion XL (Once Daily) 150 mg PO BID 3.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. \n"
