Patient was treated with IV fluids overnight for dehydration. She refused to stay in the hospital for any further work-up or treatment and stated she would rather go home to to think and see to her affairs over the weekend and consider pursuing further work-up as an outpatient. She tolerated oral fluids well w/o vomiting. She remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughout her stay. Of note patient has psychiatric history of depressive symptoms and isolation tendencies. She denied any SI/SA or any risk to herself. She has little social supports but does have a good relationship with her driver and friend who came in and was updated by the medical team on the morning of discharge and will be taking her home. She sees a mental health provider at ___ once a month and has a good relationship with her primary care physician. Patient was dischaerged home at her request. Home medications were continued to which we added some symptomatic treatment for her cough with benzonatate and Guaifenesin. We held off on anti-emetics for now as she did not want to stay inhouse to make sure these would be well tolerated (would need to monitor for drug interactions given multiple QTc prolonging and serotonergic medications on her home meds). She was instructed to maintain good hydration and try a soft diet at home if she can not tolerate regular diet. The patient met with SW who provided her with resources for community councelling. Outpatient appointments with oncology, GI and her PCP were set up and her PCP and mental health provider were updated. Her PCP ___ also ___ with her later today by telephone. \n",

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. 1. What is the current diagnosis of the patient's condition?\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. &lt;FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS&gt; ___ &lt;DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS&gt; You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is &gt; maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.</td>\n",

Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. &lt;FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS&gt; ___ &lt;DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS&gt; You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. 1. What is the current diagnosis of the patient's condition?\\nThe final answer is:  Pancreatic head mass.</td>\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP &amp; LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ Ph+ve ALL on dasatanib and IT MTX (cycle 9, last day ___ with a history of intracranial abscess/osteomyelitis and prolonged course of abx who presents with fever and altered mental status. # Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with fevers and altered mental status. Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] Continue PO ciprofloxacin and doxycycline for a prolonged course (likely 12 weeks) for treatment of prostatitis ___ of cipro, ___ of doxy). Last day ___.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP &amp; LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. &lt;MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION&gt; Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn &lt;DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS&gt; 1.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if &lt;25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. &lt;MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION&gt; Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn &lt;DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS&gt; 1.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If ___ have steri-strips (small white strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming until cleared by the surgical team.

Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, drink liquids with electrolytes such as Gatorade.

On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___.

On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___.

At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much. She denies cough or sputum production, and has no rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, sore throat, arthralgias/myalgias, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity edema. She does not 2 pillow orthopnea, but states this is not new. She has no known sick contacts or recent travel. Of note, her COPD medications have recently been changed around. She was previously taking Spiriva (tiotropium) and Advair (fluticasone-salmeterol) and was changed 2 weeks ago to Tudorza Pressair (aclinidium) and Dulera (mometasone-formoterol); however she states her insurance would not cover Tudorza, and so while she has been taking an ___ (Dulera) she has been without an inhaled anticholinergic. She also stopped taking daily prednisone 5mg PO 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of her pulmonologist. She was brought in by ambulance to the ___ ED. In the ED, triage vitals were HR 112, BP 165/106. Initial in room vitals were T 99.2, HR 107, bp 147/83, RR 19, SPO2 100% on facemask 50%. She was noted to have decreased breath sounds bilaterally with faint wheezing, no rales, tachypneic but speaking in full sentences. CXR did not show pleural effusion or focal consolidation, but demonstrated prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, especially at the lung bases, without frank pulmonary edema. Labs were notable for Hgb 11.9 (baseline ___, bicarbonate 33, lactate 1.2.

       "      <td>Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on home O2 presenting with respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and tachycardia, and subjective fevers of unknown cause, consistent with mild COPD exacerbation. She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist. She was found to be tachycardic on the medical floor so she was changed to xopenex nebs. She should continue her home azithromycin on discharge. #ANXIETY: continued home escitalopram and lorazepam #HYPERTENSION: continued home verapamil and furosemide #OSTEOPOROSIS: continued home vitamin D Transitional issues: - this COPD exacerbation appears to have been provoked by stopping Spiriva, and changing Symbicort to mometasone/formeterol. On discharge from rehab will need to clarify if patient is able to obtain meds at home. - Please taper prednisone by 10mg qweekly</td>\n",

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study.

Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W &amp; W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W &amp; W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

       "      <td>The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service with an intraventricular mass in the ICU for close monitoring. He was started on Decadron and dilantin. An MRI was obtained to further characterize the lesion. A staging CT of the torso was obtained which showed metastasis to the lungs, left hilum, and spine. He was hydrated with bicarb fluids and given Mucomyst for renal protection prior to the CT scans. On HD#2 he was transferred to the neuro step down unit. A WAND study was obtained for image guidance of the resection. He was taken to the OR for resection of the brain mass on HD#5. He tolerated the procedure well and initially recovered in the PACU. He was extubated in the PACU without difficulty. He was then transferred to the neurosurgery step down unit. On POD#1 a repeat MRI was obtained which showed no bleeding. He was then transferred to the floor. On POD#2 his diet was advanced, his Foley was removed and he was seen by ___. His Decadron was weaned to 2 mg TID. He was seen by oncology and radiation oncology who recommended follow up in the brain tumor clinic and the ___ clinic. These appointments were set up for the patient. His antibiotics were stopped on POD#4. On POD#5 he was tolerating a regular diet, he had had a bowel movement, he was voiding without difficulty and he was cleared by ___ for home.

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is > maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.           3496           1143

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. 1. What is the current diagnosis of the patient's condition?\\nThe final answer is:  Pancreatic head mass.\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing Hysteropexy (using Elevate system from AMS), posterior colporrhaphy, insertion of biologic graft in the posterior compartment. Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with Iv dilaudid and toradol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her foley was removed and a formal voiding trial was performed. She passed her voiding trial with the following values: 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 50cc straight catheterized; 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 80cc bladder scanned. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to percocet and motrin. By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.           1119            221

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. ___ will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact ___ regarding these results they will contact ___ before this time. ___ have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. ___ may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If ___ have steri-strips (small white strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming until cleared by the surgical team. Pain: It is expected that ___ will have pain after surgery and this pain will gradually improve over the first week or so ___ are home. ___ will especially have pain when changing positions and with movement. ___ should continue to take 2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. ___ may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days, please take Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your pain to a point where ___ can ambulate and perform minor tasks, ___ should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a car if taking narcotic pain medications. Activity ___ may feel weak or \"washed out\" for up to 6 weeks after surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks.

Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, drink liquids with electrolytes such as Gatorade. Please monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, dizziness especially when ___ stand, cramps in your abdomen or legs, increased thirst, or weakness. If ___ notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a regular diet with your new ileostomy. However, it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to ___ by the ostomy nurses. ___ monitor the appearance of your stoma and care for it as instructed by the ostomy nurses. ___ stoma should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched but this will improve over time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen. Our hope is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care!   Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy. He was initially admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ however was transferred to ___ on ___. Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if <25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. ___ will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact ___ regarding these results they will contact ___ before this time. ___ have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. ___ may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If ___ have steri-strips (small white strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming until cleared by the surgical team. Pain: It is expected that ___ will have pain after surgery and this pain will gradually improve over the first week or so ___ are home. ___ will especially have pain when changing positions and with movement. ___ should continue to take 2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. ___ may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days, please take Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your pain to a point where ___ can ambulate and perform minor tasks, ___ should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a car if taking narcotic pain medications. Activity ___ may feel weak or \"washed out\" for up to 6 weeks after surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks.

Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, drink liquids with electrolytes such as Gatorade. Please monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, dizziness especially when ___ stand, cramps in your abdomen or legs, increased thirst, or weakness. If ___ notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a regular diet with your new ileostomy. However, it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to ___ by the ostomy nurses. ___ monitor the appearance of your stoma and care for it as instructed by the ostomy nurses. ___ stoma should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched but this will improve over time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen.

removed) ___. -Thoracentesis, right side ___. <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> This is a ___ year old female with a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___. She has one aunts who developed breast cancer (in her ___). Another aunt had an unknown cancer. <PHYSICAL EXAM> Vitals - T 96.3, BP 114/63, HR 80, RR 22, 02 sat 94% on 1L.

INVASIVE PROCEDURE> -Paracentesis (5L fluid removed) ___. -Thoracentesis, right side ___. <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> This is a ___ year old female with a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___. She has one aunts who developed breast cancer (in her ___). Another aunt had an unknown cancer. <PHYSICAL EXAM> Vitals - T 96.3, BP 114/63, HR 80, RR 22, 02 sat 94% on 1L.

Pt started on BiPAP by EMS and continued on MICU admission after downtitration of settings. Pt diuresed with IV lasix and nitro gtt for afterload reduction and transferred to the CCU in the setting of positive cardiac enzymes. He was sent home on PO lasix to help prevent further CHF exacerbations and subsequent respiratory distress. # Positive cardiac enzymes: Most recent cath on ___ showed 3 vessel coronary artery disease, a patent LIMA-LAD graft, and 70% stenosis of the SVG-Diag-Ramus graft at the site of the Diag touchdown. Patient never complained of chest pain. His ECG was unremarkable for ischemia but he did have an elevated troponin and CK-MB likely due to demand ischemia in the context of CHF exacerbation and stable severe coronary artery disease. Patient was not started on dual anticoagulation and not cathed. # Melena: Hct stable from recent discharge. Pt with 10 days of intermitent melena at rehab and remained hemodynamic stability suggesting slow GIB. Pt initially on PPI gtt and transitioned to IV PPI BID. Trended Hct and was stable. Pt subsequently transitioned back to PO PPI. Gi consulted and felt that diarrhea and melena could be ___ to his infection vs. hyperthyroidism vs. malabsorptive syndrome vs. vasculitis. Will be seen as an outpt in GI clinic for further follow-up with possible EGD/colonoscopy. # Cdiff: Patient has had diarrhea for the past 3 weeks prior to admission. In house he was found to be C. Diff positive and started on PO antibiotics with improvement in diarrhea.           2215            451

OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on 4L home oxygen presenting with gradually worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much. She denies cough or sputum production, and has no rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, sore throat, arthralgias/myalgias, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity edema. She does not 2 pillow orthopnea, but states this is not new. She has no known sick contacts or recent travel. Of note, her COPD medications have recently been changed around. She was previously taking Spiriva (tiotropium) and Advair (fluticasone-salmeterol) and was changed 2 weeks ago to Tudorza Pressair (aclinidium) and Dulera (mometasone-formoterol); however she states her insurance would not cover Tudorza, and so while she has been taking an ___ (Dulera) she has been without an inhaled anticholinergic. She also stopped taking daily prednisone 5mg PO 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of her pulmonologist. She was brought in by ambulance to the ___ ED. In the ED, triage vitals were HR 112, BP 165/106. Initial in room vitals were T 99.2, HR 107, bp 147/83, RR 19, SPO2 100% on facemask 50%. She was noted to have decreased breath sounds bilaterally with faint wheezing, no rales, tachypneic but speaking in full sentences. CXR did not show pleural effusion or focal consolidation, but demonstrated prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, especially at the lung bases, without frank pulmonary edema. Labs were notable for Hgb 11.9 (baseline ___, bicarbonate 33, lactate 1.2. She was treated with azithromycin 500mg IV, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, oseltamivir 75mg, and 1000mL normal saline. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -COPD: PFT ___: FEV1 12% predicted (250cc FEV1), FVC 35% predicted, FEV1/FVC 34% predicted; on home O2 since ___, currently 4L by NC; h/o intubation and tracheostomy x 2 -History of melanoma -Osteoporosis; history of multiple vertebral fractures due to chronic corticosteroid use -Hypertension -Anxiety -History of positive PPD s/p 6mos of isoniazid <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Great uncle had MI in ___, Maternal & Paternal GMs had CVAs in ___.

Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on home O2 presenting with respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and tachycardia, and subjective fevers of unknown cause, consistent with mild COPD exacerbation. She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist. She was found to be tachycardic on the medical floor so she was changed to xopenex nebs. She should continue her home azithromycin on discharge. #ANXIETY: continued home escitalopram and lorazepam #HYPERTENSION: continued home verapamil and furosemide #OSTEOPOROSIS: continued home vitamin D Transitional issues: - this COPD exacerbation appears to have been provoked by stopping Spiriva, and changing Symbicort to mometasone/formeterol. On discharge from rehab will need to clarify if patient is able to obtain meds at home. - Please taper prednisone by 10mg qweekly           2132            416

on exertion <MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURE> None <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on 4L home oxygen presenting with gradually worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. &lt;FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS&gt; ___ &lt;DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS&gt; You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is &gt; maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.</td>\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP &amp; LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] Continue PO ciprofloxacin and doxycycline for a prolonged course (likely 12 weeks) for treatment of prostatitis ___ of cipro, ___ of doxy). Last day ___. [] Pt started on zonisamide, will continue until follow-up with neurology in clinic to define course [] Please monitor QTc interval regularly as pt on several prolonging agents (dasatinib, escitalopram) [] Patient will need to follow up with ID [] Patient will need to follow-up with Neurology ~ 10 days after discharge [] Patient should follow up with neurosurgery in beginning of ___, appt can be made by calling ___ [] Full code, HCT ___ (son): ___</td>\n",

The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis.

       "      <td>On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing Hysteropexy (using Elevate system from AMS), posterior colporrhaphy, insertion of biologic graft in the posterior compartment. Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with Iv dilaudid and toradol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her foley was removed and a formal voiding trial was performed. She passed her voiding trial with the following values: 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 50cc straight catheterized; 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 80cc bladder scanned. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to percocet and motrin. By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.</td>\n",

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5.

       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy. He was initially admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ however was transferred to ___ on ___. Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if &lt;25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. will need to f/u with PCP ___ 2 weeks about resumption of other BP meds 2. will need a repeat splenic ultra-sound in 3 months Include in for Every Patient and check of boxes that apply: Post-Surgical Complications During Inpatient Admission: [ ] Post-Operative Ileus resolving w/o NGT [x] Post-Operative Ileus requiring management with NGT [ ] UTI [ ] Wound Infection [ ] Anastomotic Leak [ ] Staple Line Bleed [ ] Congestive Heart failure [ ] ARF [ ] Acute Urinary retention, failure to void after Foley D/C'd [ ] Acute Urinary Retention requiring discharge with Foley Catheter [ ] DVT [ ] Pneumonia [ ] Abscess [x] None Social Issues Causing a Delay in Discharge: [ ] Delay in organization of ___ services [ ] Difficulty finding appropriate rehab hospital disposition.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm.

He was sent home on PO lasix to help prevent further CHF exacerbations and subsequent respiratory distress. # Positive cardiac enzymes: Most recent cath on ___ showed 3 vessel coronary artery disease, a patent LIMA-LAD graft, and 70% stenosis of the SVG-Diag-Ramus graft at the site of the Diag touchdown. Patient never complained of chest pain. His ECG was unremarkable for ischemia but he did have an elevated troponin and CK-MB likely due to demand ischemia in the context of CHF exacerbation and stable severe coronary artery disease. Patient was not started on dual anticoagulation and not cathed. # Melena: Hct stable from recent discharge. Pt with 10 days of intermitent melena at rehab and remained hemodynamic stability suggesting slow GIB. Pt initially on PPI gtt and transitioned to IV PPI BID. Trended Hct and was stable. Pt subsequently transitioned back to PO PPI. Gi consulted and felt that diarrhea and melena could be ___ to his infection vs. hyperthyroidism vs. malabsorptive syndrome vs. vasculitis. Will be seen as an outpt in GI clinic for further follow-up with possible EGD/colonoscopy. # Cdiff: Patient has had diarrhea for the past 3 weeks prior to admission. In house he was found to be C. Diff positive and started on PO antibiotics with improvement in diarrhea.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on home O2 presenting with respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and tachycardia, and subjective fevers of unknown cause, consistent with mild COPD exacerbation. She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist. She was found to be tachycardic on the medical floor so she was changed to xopenex nebs. She should continue her home azithromycin on discharge. #ANXIETY: continued home escitalopram and lorazepam #HYPERTENSION: continued home verapamil and furosemide #OSTEOPOROSIS: continued home vitamin D Transitional issues: - this COPD exacerbation appears to have been provoked by stopping Spiriva, and changing Symbicort to mometasone/formeterol. On discharge from rehab will need to clarify if patient is able to obtain meds at home. - Please taper prednisone by 10mg qweekly</td>\n",

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W &amp; W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W &amp; W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

       "      <td>The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service with an intraventricular mass in the ICU for close monitoring. He was started on Decadron and dilantin. An MRI was obtained to further characterize the lesion. A staging CT of the torso was obtained which showed metastasis to the lungs, left hilum, and spine. He was hydrated with bicarb fluids and given Mucomyst for renal protection prior to the CT scans. On HD#2 he was transferred to the neuro step down unit. A WAND study was obtained for image guidance of the resection. He was taken to the OR for resection of the brain mass on HD#5. He tolerated the procedure well and initially recovered in the PACU. He was extubated in the PACU without difficulty. He was then transferred to the neurosurgery step down unit. On POD#1 a repeat MRI was obtained which showed no bleeding. He was then transferred to the floor. On POD#2 his diet was advanced, his Foley was removed and he was seen by ___. His Decadron was weaned to 2 mg TID. He was seen by oncology and radiation oncology who recommended follow up in the brain tumor clinic and the ___ clinic. These appointments were set up for the patient. His antibiotics were stopped on POD#4. On POD#5 he was tolerating a regular diet, he had had a bowel movement, he was voiding without difficulty and he was cleared by ___ for home.

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is > maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.           3496           1143

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. 1. What is the current diagnosis of the patient's condition?\\nThe final answer is:  Pancreatic head mass.\n",

No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst.

On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing Hysteropexy (using Elevate system from AMS), posterior colporrhaphy, insertion of biologic graft in the posterior compartment. Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with Iv dilaudid and toradol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her foley was removed and a formal voiding trial was performed. She passed her voiding trial with the following values: 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 50cc straight catheterized; 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 80cc bladder scanned. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to percocet and motrin. By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.           1119            221

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office.

Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office.

The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen. Our hope is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care!   Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if <25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. ___ will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact ___ regarding these results they will contact ___ before this time. ___ have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. ___ may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If ___ have steri-strips (small white strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming until cleared by the surgical team. Pain: It is expected that ___ will have pain after surgery and this pain will gradually improve over the first week or so ___ are home. ___ will especially have pain when changing positions and with movement. ___ should continue to take 2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. ___ may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days, please take Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your pain to a point where ___ can ambulate and perform minor tasks, ___ should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a car if taking narcotic pain medications. Activity ___ may feel weak or \"washed out\" for up to 6 weeks after surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks.

Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, drink liquids with electrolytes such as Gatorade. Please monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, dizziness especially when ___ stand, cramps in your abdomen or legs, increased thirst, or weakness. If ___ notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a regular diet with your new ileostomy. However, it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to ___ by the ostomy nurses. ___ monitor the appearance of your stoma and care for it as instructed by the ostomy nurses. ___ stoma should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched but this will improve over time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen.

removed) ___. -Thoracentesis, right side ___. <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> This is a ___ year old female with a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___. She has one aunts who developed breast cancer (in her ___). Another aunt had an unknown cancer. <PHYSICAL EXAM> Vitals - T 96.3, BP 114/63, HR 80, RR 22, 02 sat 94% on 1L.

INVASIVE PROCEDURE> -Paracentesis (5L fluid removed) ___. -Thoracentesis, right side ___. <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> This is a ___ year old female with a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -==== -Morbid obesity -Low back pain -Depression -OSA, severe, on nasal CPAP (setting 11) -Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate) -Hyperlipidemia -Mild aortic insufficiency with a history of prior use of fenfluramine -Perimenopausal mood disorder <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> She reports her brother had skin cancer (in his ___) and a nephew of hers had testicular cancer (at age ___. She has one aunts who developed breast cancer (in her ___). Another aunt had an unknown cancer. <PHYSICAL EXAM> Vitals - T 96.3, BP 114/63, HR 80, RR 22, 02 sat 94% on 1L.

Pt started on BiPAP by EMS and continued on MICU admission after downtitration of settings. Pt diuresed with IV lasix and nitro gtt for afterload reduction and transferred to the CCU in the setting of positive cardiac enzymes. He was sent home on PO lasix to help prevent further CHF exacerbations and subsequent respiratory distress. # Positive cardiac enzymes: Most recent cath on ___ showed 3 vessel coronary artery disease, a patent LIMA-LAD graft, and 70% stenosis of the SVG-Diag-Ramus graft at the site of the Diag touchdown. Patient never complained of chest pain. His ECG was unremarkable for ischemia but he did have an elevated troponin and CK-MB likely due to demand ischemia in the context of CHF exacerbation and stable severe coronary artery disease. Patient was not started on dual anticoagulation and not cathed. # Melena: Hct stable from recent discharge. Pt with 10 days of intermitent melena at rehab and remained hemodynamic stability suggesting slow GIB. Pt initially on PPI gtt and transitioned to IV PPI BID. Trended Hct and was stable. Pt subsequently transitioned back to PO PPI. Gi consulted and felt that diarrhea and melena could be ___ to his infection vs. hyperthyroidism vs. malabsorptive syndrome vs. vasculitis. Will be seen as an outpt in GI clinic for further follow-up with possible EGD/colonoscopy. # Cdiff: Patient has had diarrhea for the past 3 weeks prior to admission. In house he was found to be C. Diff positive and started on PO antibiotics with improvement in diarrhea.           2215            451

OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on 4L home oxygen presenting with gradually worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much. She denies cough or sputum production, and has no rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, sore throat, arthralgias/myalgias, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity edema. She does not 2 pillow orthopnea, but states this is not new. She has no known sick contacts or recent travel. Of note, her COPD medications have recently been changed around. She was previously taking Spiriva (tiotropium) and Advair (fluticasone-salmeterol) and was changed 2 weeks ago to Tudorza Pressair (aclinidium) and Dulera (mometasone-formoterol); however she states her insurance would not cover Tudorza, and so while she has been taking an ___ (Dulera) she has been without an inhaled anticholinergic. She also stopped taking daily prednisone 5mg PO 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of her pulmonologist. She was brought in by ambulance to the ___ ED. In the ED, triage vitals were HR 112, BP 165/106. Initial in room vitals were T 99.2, HR 107, bp 147/83, RR 19, SPO2 100% on facemask 50%. She was noted to have decreased breath sounds bilaterally with faint wheezing, no rales, tachypneic but speaking in full sentences. CXR did not show pleural effusion or focal consolidation, but demonstrated prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, especially at the lung bases, without frank pulmonary edema. Labs were notable for Hgb 11.9 (baseline ___, bicarbonate 33, lactate 1.2. She was treated with azithromycin 500mg IV, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, oseltamivir 75mg, and 1000mL normal saline. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -COPD: PFT ___: FEV1 12% predicted (250cc FEV1), FVC 35% predicted, FEV1/FVC 34% predicted; on home O2 since ___, currently 4L by NC; h/o intubation and tracheostomy x 2 -History of melanoma -Osteoporosis; history of multiple vertebral fractures due to chronic corticosteroid use -Hypertension -Anxiety -History of positive PPD s/p 6mos of isoniazid <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Great uncle had MI in ___, Maternal & Paternal GMs had CVAs in ___.

Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on home O2 presenting with respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and tachycardia, and subjective fevers of unknown cause, consistent with mild COPD exacerbation. She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist. She was found to be tachycardic on the medical floor so she was changed to xopenex nebs. She should continue her home azithromycin on discharge. #ANXIETY: continued home escitalopram and lorazepam #HYPERTENSION: continued home verapamil and furosemide #OSTEOPOROSIS: continued home vitamin D Transitional issues: - this COPD exacerbation appears to have been provoked by stopping Spiriva, and changing Symbicort to mometasone/formeterol. On discharge from rehab will need to clarify if patient is able to obtain meds at home. - Please taper prednisone by 10mg qweekly           2132            416

on exertion <MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURE> None <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on 4L home oxygen presenting with gradually worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.
