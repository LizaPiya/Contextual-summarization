The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. &lt;FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS&gt; ___ &lt;DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS&gt; You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is &gt; maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.</td>\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP &amp; LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ &lt;SOCIAL HISTORY&gt; ___ &lt;FAMILY HISTORY&gt; His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. &lt;MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION&gt; Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn &lt;DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS&gt; 1.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub.

Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output.

However, it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to ___ by the ostomy nurses. ___ monitor the appearance of your stoma and care for it as instructed by the ostomy nurses. ___ stoma should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched but this will improve over time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen. Our hope is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care!</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy. He was initially admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ however was transferred to ___ on ___. Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if &lt;25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. will need to f/u with PCP ___ 2 weeks about resumption of other BP meds 2. will need a repeat splenic ultra-sound in 3 months Include in for Every Patient and check of boxes that apply: Post-Surgical Complications During Inpatient Admission: [ ] Post-Operative Ileus resolving w/o NGT [x] Post-Operative Ileus requiring management with NGT [ ] UTI [ ] Wound Infection [ ] Anastomotic Leak [ ] Staple Line Bleed [ ] Congestive Heart failure [ ] ARF [ ] Acute Urinary retention, failure to void after Foley D/C'd [ ] Acute Urinary Retention requiring discharge with Foley Catheter [ ] DVT [ ] Pneumonia [ ] Abscess [x] None Social Issues Causing a Delay in Discharge: [ ] Delay in organization of ___ services [ ] Difficulty finding appropriate rehab hospital disposition.

On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. &lt;PAST MEDICAL HISTORY&gt; PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary. The right ovary was not clearly identified and there was a moderate amount of ascites. Essentially, the only disease that she has at this point that is visible is the fluid and the omental cake. All told; however, this is consistent with a primary peritoneal cancer. Her CA-125 level is notably elevated at 226 and she has had a normal CEA level drawn.

She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist.

Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W &amp; W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W &amp; W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the ICU at which time the patients lumbar drain was capped, SBPs were controlled briefly on/off nitro and eventually off nitro. On POD#1 we obtained a CTA which was negative for an endoleak, the patient was on a regular diet, drain was capped and we decided that the patient should stay in the ICU overnight. On POD#2, the patients drain came out, we removed the patients foley, A-line and moved the patient to our VICU. On POD#3 the patient was ambulating well and ready for discharge home. Post-operatively, he did well without any groin swelling. He was able to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and ambulate without assistance, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions.</td>\n",

The patient explains she was in her usual state of health one day prior to admission, and enjoyed a \"long\" swim on ___. Following her swim she recalls napping for two hours and awakening feeling well. However, she thereafter noted the gradual onset of \"discomfort\" limited to the \"skull\" behind her right ear. She describes the discomfort as \"dull\" and rating ___ on a 10-point pain scale at its worst. She denies radiation of the discomfort. She denies identifiable triggers and exacerbating factors. She denies associated symptoms including phono- and photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck discomfort, changes in vision, and ear discomfort. She did not treat the HA or mention alleviating factors. She recalls going to bed as usual and falling to sleep without difficulty. She indicates her headache must have \"disappeared\" in the course of her sleep because she awakened feeling her usual self at a customary time between ___. The pt describes enjoying a \"lazy\" holiday morning. She recalls preparing breakfast while standing upright between 10: 30 and 11am. At that time, she describes \"stretching\" by fully extending her neck. In the midst of the maneuver, she states she developed an acute sense of \"severe sea-sickness,\" requiring her to hold on to the nearby oven for support. She says she had diarrhea within about three minutes of the symptom, and had to crawl to the bathroom because attempts to walk resulted in the persistent feeling that she would fall to the right. Other associated symptoms included nausea, although the pt denies vomiting. Following the episode of diarrhea, she assumed a supine position. She says that lying still \"with no movement\" seemed to decrease the intensity of the feeling of sea-sickness. She denies similar episodes in the past. The sx prompted her to call her PCP, who recommended she go to the ED for evaluation. The pt initially presented to the ___ by ambulance. The pt recalls the persistence of sea-sickness and nausea for about ___ hours until she was given an IV (which she thinks provided NS). This examiner could not elucidate from the available notes what treatment was given. The pt recalls a transient (~30 minute episode) of \"blurred vision\" while at ___ which she said spontaneously resolved. Notes suggest that the physicians at the OSH noted \"faint fatiguing nystagmus to the right\" and inferior visual field cuts. Reportedly, the laboratory studies, EKG, and CT performed at the outside hospital were normal or negative. She was subsequently transferred to the ___ for evaluation. En route by ambulance, the pt developed a headache in the occipital regions bilaterally. She recalls a gradual onset of non-radiating discomfort that rated ___ at its worst; she could not define the time from onset to peak discomfort. Since that time, she notes that the headache has moved to the temporal regions bilaterally and is much improved; she rates the discomfort as ___. She attributes the discomfort to \"not eating\" all day. At the time of evaluation, the pt reports feeling herself. She denies a sense of sea-sickness and nausea. She indicates her vision has completely normalized. Although she continues to experience slight bi-temporal \"dull\" discomfort, she indicates the sx is unlike her prior migraines. She denies any migraines for the ___ yrs PTA. On neurological review of systems, the pt specifically denies experiencing the \"room spinning around\" her and the sense that she might lose consciousness. Rather, she volunteers having felt as though she \"might fall\" from lack of balance. She denies neck pain. Of note, the pt recalls recent redecoration activities and describes herself as a ___. While she does recall assuming a position in which she extended her neck to paint the ceiling, she notes in was a \"long time ago.\" She does note a ~1month hx of second-long episodes of left ___ discomfort. She indicates it feels as though she is \"punched in the eye.\" She recalls 1 episode every ___ days. She denies associated tearing, congestion, and HA; the sx spontaneously resolves. General review of systems is positive for an URI in the 2 weeks prior to admission that included \"sinus sx,\" maximum temperature of ___ F, and sore throat. She denies associated ear discomfort and hearing difficulty. She treated the URI with \"homeopathic\" remedies and states she was feeling better by one week PTA.

ECHO ___: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation (inferior free wall is frankly akinetic) (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to global contractile dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, dyssynchrony. A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transthoracic study with transpulmonic microbubble contrast is recommended to better define the endocardium of the left ventricle. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, left ventricular contractile function is now severely impaired. B/l ___ VENOUS ULTRASOUND ___: FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the bilateral common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower extremity veins. -=========== DISCHARGE LABS: ___ 06: 05AM BLOOD WBC-7.9 RBC-4.78 Hgb-15.0 Hct-45.1* MCV-94 MCH-31.4 MCHC-33.3 RDW-12.3 RDWSD-42.8 Plt ___ ___ 06: 05AM BLOOD Glucose-105* UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-139 K-4.2 Cl-97 HCO3-24 AnGap-22* &lt;MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION&gt; The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. &lt;FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS&gt; ___ &lt;DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS&gt; Dear ___, You were admitted to the hospital because you had been feeling short of breath and you were found to have fluid on your lungs. This was due to a condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up into your lungs. The cause of this is still unclear. Many tests were sent but did not show a clear cause. You were given a diuretic medication through the IV to help get the fluid out. You were also found to have a blood clot in your heart. This was treated with blood thinners. You will continue injections of enoxaparin (Lovenox) until your warfarin (Coumadin) levels come up. When you were ready to leave the hospital, you were set up with a device to monitor your heart. You will follow up closely with our heart failure specialists to continue to manage this issue. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below) - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Weigh yourself every morning, seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night. It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the best! -Your ___ Care Team</td>\n",

Another ECHO study with lumison showed a large apical LV thrombus. Patient was started on anticoagulation with lovenox as a bridge to therapeutic warfarin. She was discharged on the following heart failure med regimen: lasix 20 mg, metoprolol XL 12.5 mg, lisinopril ___s a life vest. She will follow up in ___ clinic as well as long-term with Dr. ___ to manage this issue. =========================== CARDIAC HISTORY: # CORONARIES: ETT in ___ with inducible LBBB # PUMP: HFrEF unclear etiology, EF 15%, LV severe global HK, RV mod global HK. # RHYTHM: NSR with LBBB ACTIVE ISSUES: # ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Pt presented with DOE and orthopnea 3 weeks after viral URI. Found to have BNP 6915, CXR with cardiomegaly, pulm vascular congestion, small b/l pleural effusions. TTE w/ new EF 15%, global dysfunction (prior TTE in ___ w/ EF 50%). Only cardiac risk factor HLD. Previously had stress test with rate-related LBBB and EF 50%. On admission, Trop negative x2, EKG with full LBBB. Most likely non-ischemic CMP of unclear source. Work-up negative for non-ischemic cuases: HIV negative, iron studies normal, SPEP normal, ___ negative, TSH normal, Free ___ normal. Ddx still includes viral myocarditis vs idiopathic. ECHO with lumison showed large LV thrombus. Defering cath at this time given LV thrombus, but will need CAD ruled out definitively in future with LHC. Also would benefit from cardiac MR to evaluate for myocarditis, scar as outpatient. She was diuresied with Lasix IV 20 mg to dry weight of 80.2 kg and started on metoprolol succ 12.5 mg and lisinopril 5 mg, then uptitrated to 10 mg, which were well tolerated. She was discharged with a Life Vest after discussion with the patient and her family. Consideration should be given to early CRT depending upon her clinical and ECHO response to ___ medical therapy given that she is female with likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a relatively wide LBBB. Her medical regimen at discharge included: - Lasix 20mg daily - Metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg - Lisinopril 10 mg daily (consider switch to ___ if persistent dry cough) - Consider the addition of spironolactone after titration of the beta-blocker and ACEi. # LV Thrombus: ECHO with lumison ___ showed large (2.3 x 0.9 cm) mural thrombus along the apical inferior left ventricular wall. ___ new HFrEF.

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6. Mild splenomegaly. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Atorvastatin 80 mg PO QPM 2. BuPROPion XL (Once Daily) 150 mg PO BID 3.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is > maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.           3496           1143\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] Continue PO ciprofloxacin and doxycycline for a prolonged course (likely 12 weeks) for treatment of prostatitis ___ of cipro, ___ of doxy). Last day ___. [] Pt started on zonisamide, will continue until follow-up with neurology in clinic to define course [] Please monitor QTc interval regularly as pt on several prolonging agents (dasatinib, escitalopram) [] Patient will need to follow up with ID [] Patient will need to follow-up with Neurology ~ 10 days after discharge [] Patient should follow up with neurosurgery in beginning of ___, appt can be made by calling ___ [] Full code, HCT ___ (son): ___           5591           1098\n",

On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing Hysteropexy (using Elevate system from AMS), posterior colporrhaphy, insertion of biologic graft in the posterior compartment. Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with Iv dilaudid and toradol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her foley was removed and a formal voiding trial was performed. She passed her voiding trial with the following values: 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 50cc straight catheterized; 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 80cc bladder scanned. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to percocet and motrin. By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.           1119            221\n",

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear ___ ___ were admitted to the hospital after a completion colectomy for surgical management of your colon cancer. ___ have recovered from this procedure well and ___ are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. ___ will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact ___ regarding these results they will contact ___ before this time. ___ have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. ___ may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. ___ may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable; however it is important that ___ have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but ___ should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if ___ notice that ___ are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If ___ are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that ___ will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If ___ have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice ___: fever greater than 101.5 increasing abdominal distension increasing abdominal pain nausea/vomiting inability to tolerate food or liquids prolonged loose stool extended constipation inability to urinate Incisions: ___ have a long vertical surgical incisions on your abdomen closed with staples. This is healing well, however, it is important that ___ monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. ___ may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If ___ have steri-strips (small white strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming until cleared by the surgical team. Pain: It is expected that ___ will have pain after surgery and this pain will gradually improve over the first week or so ___ are home. ___ will especially have pain when changing positions and with movement. ___ should continue to take 2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. ___ may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days, please take Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your pain to a point where ___ can ambulate and perform minor tasks, ___ should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a car if taking narcotic pain medications. Activity ___ may feel weak or \"washed out\" for up to 6 weeks after surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks. At your first follow up appointment, your surgical team will clear ___ for heavier exercise and activity as they observe your progress. In the meantime, ___ may climb stairs, and go outside and walk. Please avoid traveling long distances until ___ speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. Again, please do not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, drink liquids with electrolytes such as Gatorade. Please monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, dizziness especially when ___ stand, cramps in your abdomen or legs, increased thirst, or weakness. If ___ notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a regular diet with your new ileostomy. However, it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to ___ by the ostomy nurses. ___ monitor the appearance of your stoma and care for it as instructed by the ostomy nurses. ___ stoma should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched but this will improve over time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen. Our hope is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care!   Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy. He was initially admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ however was transferred to ___ on ___. Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if <25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay, he/she was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was later transitioned to systemic AC in the form of therapeutic lovenox (when NPO) followed by rivaroxaban (for afib) when taking PO. On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, stooling (ileostomy), voiding, and ambulating with walker. He will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge.

fluid removed) ___. -Thoracentesis, right side ___. <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> This is a ___ year old female with a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. On a recent admission for new ascites and new effusion in the setting of omemental caking, fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma (ovarian). Cells stained positive for WT-1, cytokeratin 7 and focally for ER. She is followed by Dr. ___ who is helping to arrange initial treatment with chemotherapy prior to surgery. The patient is becoming increasingly symtpommatic (short of breath, unable to walk up stairs) from her effusion and continues to have abdominal pain from both her ascites and her renal stones. She is planning for Lithotripsy on ___. It is felt that a therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis prior to initiation of chemotherapy would be appropriate. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -====== Several weeks prior to ___ patient developed shortness of breath and has had difficulty getting around. She reports abdominal distention. She is fairly fatigued. A CT scan recently performed revealed a \"huge\" amount of ascites with caking of the omentum and also bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A pleural tap was performed on ___. This thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serous fluid. The pathology from this pleural aspiration shows adenocarcinoma. Her most recent pelvic ultrasound was obtained on ___ and this revealed a stable fibroid uterus with a normal left ovary.

Pt started on BiPAP by EMS and continued on MICU admission after downtitration of settings. Pt diuresed with IV lasix and nitro gtt for afterload reduction and transferred to the CCU in the setting of positive cardiac enzymes. He was sent home on PO lasix to help prevent further CHF exacerbations and subsequent respiratory distress. # Positive cardiac enzymes: Most recent cath on ___ showed 3 vessel coronary artery disease, a patent LIMA-LAD graft, and 70% stenosis of the SVG-Diag-Ramus graft at the site of the Diag touchdown. Patient never complained of chest pain. His ECG was unremarkable for ischemia but he did have an elevated troponin and CK-MB likely due to demand ischemia in the context of CHF exacerbation and stable severe coronary artery disease. Patient was not started on dual anticoagulation and not cathed. # Melena: Hct stable from recent discharge. Pt with 10 days of intermitent melena at rehab and remained hemodynamic stability suggesting slow GIB. Pt initially on PPI gtt and transitioned to IV PPI BID. Trended Hct and was stable. Pt subsequently transitioned back to PO PPI. Gi consulted and felt that diarrhea and melena could be ___ to his infection vs. hyperthyroidism vs. malabsorptive syndrome vs. vasculitis. Will be seen as an outpt in GI clinic for further follow-up with possible EGD/colonoscopy. # Cdiff: Patient has had diarrhea for the past 3 weeks prior to admission. In house he was found to be C. Diff positive and started on PO antibiotics with improvement in diarrhea.           2215            451\n",

OF PRESENT ILLNESS> Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on 4L home oxygen presenting with gradually worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline, she reports that she has mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion (not at rest); she is able to move around her home without much difficulty, although she uses a non-powered wheelchair to get around outside the home. She reports that for the 3 days prior to presentation, she had gradually worsening dyspnea on the exertion that progressed to the point where she was having difficulty moving from her bedroom to the nearby restroom. Over this time, she notes subjective fevers and sweats at night (requiring change of clothes) although she did not take her temperature at home. She tried taking her home nebulizer (Xopenex) and rescue inhaler albuterol more frequently, and increased her oxygen to 5L, but these measures did not help much. She denies cough or sputum production, and has no rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, sore throat, arthralgias/myalgias, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity edema. She does not 2 pillow orthopnea, but states this is not new. She has no known sick contacts or recent travel. Of note, her COPD medications have recently been changed around. She was previously taking Spiriva (tiotropium) and Advair (fluticasone-salmeterol) and was changed 2 weeks ago to Tudorza Pressair (aclinidium) and Dulera (mometasone-formoterol); however she states her insurance would not cover Tudorza, and so while she has been taking an ___ (Dulera) she has been without an inhaled anticholinergic. She also stopped taking daily prednisone 5mg PO 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of her pulmonologist. She was brought in by ambulance to the ___ ED. In the ED, triage vitals were HR 112, BP 165/106. Initial in room vitals were T 99.2, HR 107, bp 147/83, RR 19, SPO2 100% on facemask 50%. She was noted to have decreased breath sounds bilaterally with faint wheezing, no rales, tachypneic but speaking in full sentences. CXR did not show pleural effusion or focal consolidation, but demonstrated prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, especially at the lung bases, without frank pulmonary edema. Labs were notable for Hgb 11.9 (baseline ___, bicarbonate 33, lactate 1.2. She was treated with azithromycin 500mg IV, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, oseltamivir 75mg, and 1000mL normal saline. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -COPD: PFT ___: FEV1 12% predicted (250cc FEV1), FVC 35% predicted, FEV1/FVC 34% predicted; on home O2 since ___, currently 4L by NC; h/o intubation and tracheostomy x 2 -History of melanoma -Osteoporosis; history of multiple vertebral fractures due to chronic corticosteroid use -Hypertension -Anxiety -History of positive PPD s/p 6mos of isoniazid <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Great uncle had MI in ___, Maternal & Paternal GMs had CVAs in ___.

Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on home O2 presenting with respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and tachycardia, and subjective fevers of unknown cause, consistent with mild COPD exacerbation. She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist. She was found to be tachycardic on the medical floor so she was changed to xopenex nebs. She should continue her home azithromycin on discharge. #ANXIETY: continued home escitalopram and lorazepam #HYPERTENSION: continued home verapamil and furosemide #OSTEOPOROSIS: continued home vitamin D Transitional issues: - this COPD exacerbation appears to have been provoked by stopping Spiriva, and changing Symbicort to mometasone/formeterol. On discharge from rehab will need to clarify if patient is able to obtain meds at home. - Please taper prednisone by 10mg qweekly           2132            416\n",

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

His urinalysis was grossly positive with leukocytosis consistent with urosepsis. This was thought to be due to foley placement for 7 days due to urinary retention after procedure for aneurysm. He was treated with IV ceftriaxone with improvement in symptoms. He remained afebrile during his hospital course, and leukocytosis downtrended to 10.7 by time of discharge. His urine culture grew gram negative rods. He is to complete 10-day course of cefpodoxime for complicated UTI.

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with AAA who was admitted to the ___ on ___. The patient was taken to the endovascular suite and underwent FEVAR. For details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the ICU at which time the patients lumbar drain was capped, SBPs were controlled briefly on/off nitro and eventually off nitro. On POD#1 we obtained a CTA which was negative for an endoleak, the patient was on a regular diet, drain was capped and we decided that the patient should stay in the ICU overnight. On POD#2, the patients drain came out, we removed the patients foley, A-line and moved the patient to our VICU. On POD#3 the patient was ambulating well and ready for discharge home. Post-operatively, he did well without any groin swelling. He was able to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and ambulate without assistance, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions.           1593            259\n",

Ms. ___ was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of her shortness of breath. She remained afebrile. Outside records were obtained from ___ and CXR showed evidence of possible pulm edema. # Shortness of breath: DDx was broad, given hx of RA and immunosuppresion. Pleuritic chest pain was thought to be radiation from lung process (given negative extremity exam). CAP was considered most likely etiology of SOB. Less likely etiologies included: legionella (esp considering hyponatremia although urine ag negative)), TB (no hx of exposure, prior PPD negative). She was also treated for pulm edema suggested by CXR (however, echo was not consistent with CHF and EKG not suggestive of MI/ACS as cause of CHF). Her leukocytosis resolved (16.3-->10.8) on Levofloxacin. Pt also rec'd Lasix w good urine output. Crackles improved on hospital day 3. - Levofloxacin to 750mg PO per day for CAP (___) Inactive Issues: #Macrocytosis Likely ___ MTX therapy. B12 and folate wnl. # RA: Followed by rheumatologist. On prednisone, orencia, relafen, leukovorin, and methotrexate and vicodin, robaxin, and tylenol 3 for pain. # Post-menopausal symptoms On medroxyprogesterone and estrogen # Depression On lexapro, gabapentin, nortryptiline, and buspirone # HTN On lisinopril and hctz # Health maintenance - continue ASA, Fe, MVI Transitional Issues: - Consider CT after resolution of infectious process given likely recurrence of PNA in R lobe (post-obstructive PNA possible). - Pls ___ blood cx from ___ (negative as of ___ - Pt on Levofloxacin until ___.

prolonged hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia who was sent in from ___ clinic with fevers. His most recent medical course dates back to ___ when the patient was admitted with MRSA bacteremia secondary to a PICC line. Hospital course complicated by left prostethic hip seeding requiring OR washout and prolonged post-op course of intubation that was complicated by several infections: Pseudomonal pneumonia +/- upper resp tract infection; Prevotella bacteremia; and tunneling sacral wound. Hospital course also c/b ARF with Cr peaking at 3.9. Eventually the patient was extubated and d/ced to LTAC with plan to continue vancomycin IV x 6weeks and then a prolonged oral course of antibiotics. Rehab course was c/b worsening L hip pain with evidence of dislocation on an X-ray taken at his LTAC. He was hospitalized again briefly for relocation of hip with recommendations to continue an abduction pillow between his legs until his follow up appointment on ___. The patient was at a routine follow up appointment at ___ when found to have fever, tachypnea and AMS. Per ID fellow, vancomycin should be changed to linezolid with addition of colisitin and Doripenem. In the ED, initial VS 100.5 HR: 88 BP: 115/44 Resp: 24 O(2)Sat: 98.

Dizziness <MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURE> None <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a remote history of migraine and head trauma who presents with a 2-hour history of acute onset \"dizziness\" in the setting of neck \"stretching\" to a fully extended position. The patient explains she was in her usual state of health one day prior to admission, and enjoyed a \"long\" swim on ___. Following her swim she recalls napping for two hours and awakening feeling well. However, she thereafter noted the gradual onset of \"discomfort\" limited to the \"skull\" behind her right ear. She describes the discomfort as \"dull\" and rating ___ on a 10-point pain scale at its worst. She denies radiation of the discomfort. She denies identifiable triggers and exacerbating factors. She denies associated symptoms including phono- and photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck discomfort, changes in vision, and ear discomfort. She did not treat the HA or mention alleviating factors. She recalls going to bed as usual and falling to sleep without difficulty. She indicates her headache must have \"disappeared\" in the course of her sleep because she awakened feeling her usual self at a customary time between ___. The pt describes enjoying a \"lazy\" holiday morning. She recalls preparing breakfast while standing upright between 10: 30 and 11am. At that time, she describes \"stretching\" by fully extending her neck. In the midst of the maneuver, she states she developed an acute sense of \"severe sea-sickness,\" requiring her to hold on to the nearby oven for support. She says she had diarrhea within about three minutes of the symptom, and had to crawl to the bathroom because attempts to walk resulted in the persistent feeling that she would fall to the right. Other associated symptoms included nausea, although the pt denies vomiting. Following the episode of diarrhea, she assumed a supine position. She says that lying still \"with no movement\" seemed to decrease the intensity of the feeling of sea-sickness. She denies similar episodes in the past. The sx prompted her to call her PCP, who recommended she go to the ED for evaluation. The pt initially presented to the ___ by ambulance. The pt recalls the persistence of sea-sickness and nausea for about ___ hours until she was given an IV (which she thinks provided NS). This examiner could not elucidate from the available notes what treatment was given. The pt recalls a transient (~30 minute episode) of \"blurred vision\" while at ___ which she said spontaneously resolved. Notes suggest that the physicians at the OSH noted \"faint fatiguing nystagmus to the right\" and inferior visual field cuts. Reportedly, the laboratory studies, EKG, and CT performed at the outside hospital were normal or negative. She was subsequently transferred to the ___ for evaluation. En route by ambulance, the pt developed a headache in the occipital regions bilaterally. She recalls a gradual onset of non-radiating discomfort that rated ___ at its worst; she could not define the time from onset to peak discomfort. Since that time, she notes that the headache has moved to the temporal regions bilaterally and is much improved; she rates the discomfort as ___. She attributes the discomfort to \"not eating\" all day. At the time of evaluation, the pt reports feeling herself. She denies a sense of sea-sickness and nausea. She indicates her vision has completely normalized. Although she continues to experience slight bi-temporal \"dull\" discomfort, she indicates the sx is unlike her prior migraines. She denies any migraines for the ___ yrs PTA. On neurological review of systems, the pt specifically denies experiencing the \"room spinning around\" her and the sense that she might lose consciousness. Rather, she volunteers having felt as though she \"might fall\" from lack of balance. She denies neck pain. Of note, the pt recalls recent redecoration activities and describes herself as a ___. While she does recall assuming a position in which she extended her neck to paint the ceiling, she notes in was a \"long time ago.\" She does note a ~1month hx of second-long episodes of left ___ discomfort. She indicates it feels as though she is \"punched in the eye.\" She recalls 1 episode every ___ days. She denies associated tearing, congestion, and HA; the sx spontaneously resolves. General review of systems is positive for an URI in the 2 weeks prior to admission that included \"sinus sx,\" maximum temperature of ___ F, and sore throat. She denies associated ear discomfort and hearing difficulty. She treated the URI with \"homeopathic\" remedies and states she was feeling better by one week PTA. NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW OF SYSTEMS - Positive for: headache, recent blurring of vision, ?tinnitus (pt cannot identify which ear or when the ringing might have occurred but says she had the sense the sx was present recently) - Negative for: lightheadedness, vision loss, double vision, difficulty hearing, trouble speaking, trouble swallowing, difficulty producing or understanding speech, focal weakness, numbness, tingling, neck discomfort, and bowel incontinence.

On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy, total vaginal hysterectomy, cystoscopy. Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with dilaudid and toradol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her foley was removed and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to vicodin, ibuprofen. By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.           1192            154\n",

Heart remains moderately enlarged. While there is no frank edema, the hila appear slightly congested. Tiny pleural effusions are suspected. No convincing evidence for pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour is stable. Bony structures are intact. IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly with mild hilar congestion. Tiny pleural effusions. ECHO ___: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation (inferior free wall is frankly akinetic) (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to global contractile dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, dyssynchrony. A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transthoracic study with transpulmonic microbubble contrast is recommended to better define the endocardium of the left ventricle. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, left ventricular contractile function is now severely impaired. B/l ___ VENOUS ULTRASOUND ___: FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the bilateral common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower extremity veins. -=========== DISCHARGE LABS: ___ 06: 05AM BLOOD WBC-7.9 RBC-4.78 Hgb-15.0 Hct-45.1* MCV-94 MCH-31.4 MCHC-33.3 RDW-12.3 RDWSD-42.8 Plt ___ ___ 06: 05AM BLOOD Glucose-105* UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-139 K-4.2 Cl-97 HCO3-24 AnGap-22* <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear ___, You were admitted to the hospital because you had been feeling short of breath and you were found to have fluid on your lungs. This was due to a condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up into your lungs. The cause of this is still unclear. Many tests were sent but did not show a clear cause. You were given a diuretic medication through the IV to help get the fluid out. You were also found to have a blood clot in your heart. This was treated with blood thinners. You will continue injections of enoxaparin (Lovenox) until your warfarin (Coumadin) levels come up. When you were ready to leave the hospital, you were set up with a device to monitor your heart. You will follow up closely with our heart failure specialists to continue to manage this issue. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below) - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Weigh yourself every morning, seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night. It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the best! -Your ___ Care Team                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 BRIEF COURSE: ___ with limited PMH presented with DOE and orthopnea 3 weeks after viral URI. Found to have BNP 6915, CXR with cardiomegaly, pulm vascular congestion, small b/l pleural effusions. Pt found to have new systolic heart failure with TTE showing EF 15%, global dysfunction (prior TTE in ___ w/ EF 50%). She was diuresed with lasix IV 20 mg to a dry weight of 80.2 kg. Another ECHO study with lumison showed a large apical LV thrombus. Patient was started on anticoagulation with lovenox as a bridge to therapeutic warfarin. She was discharged on the following heart failure med regimen: lasix 20 mg, metoprolol XL 12.5 mg, lisinopril ___s a life vest. She will follow up in ___ clinic as well as long-term with Dr. ___ to manage this issue. =========================== CARDIAC HISTORY: # CORONARIES: ETT in ___ with inducible LBBB # PUMP: HFrEF unclear etiology, EF 15%, LV severe global HK, RV mod global HK. # RHYTHM: NSR with LBBB ACTIVE ISSUES: # ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Pt presented with DOE and orthopnea 3 weeks after viral URI. Found to have BNP 6915, CXR with cardiomegaly, pulm vascular congestion, small b/l pleural effusions. TTE w/ new EF 15%, global dysfunction (prior TTE in ___ w/ EF 50%). Only cardiac risk factor HLD. Previously had stress test with rate-related LBBB and EF 50%. On admission, Trop negative x2, EKG with full LBBB. Most likely non-ischemic CMP of unclear source. Work-up negative for non-ischemic cuases: HIV negative, iron studies normal, SPEP normal, ___ negative, TSH normal, Free ___ normal. Ddx still includes viral myocarditis vs idiopathic. ECHO with lumison showed large LV thrombus. Defering cath at this time given LV thrombus, but will need CAD ruled out definitively in future with LHC. Also would benefit from cardiac MR to evaluate for myocarditis, scar as outpatient. She was diuresied with Lasix IV 20 mg to dry weight of 80.2 kg and started on metoprolol succ 12.5 mg and lisinopril 5 mg, then uptitrated to 10 mg, which were well tolerated. She was discharged with a Life Vest after discussion with the patient and her family. Consideration should be given to early CRT depending upon her clinical and ECHO response to ___ medical therapy given that she is female with likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a relatively wide LBBB. Her medical regimen at discharge included: - Lasix 20mg daily - Metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg - Lisinopril 10 mg daily (consider switch to ___ if persistent dry cough) - Consider the addition of spironolactone after titration of the beta-blocker and ACEi. # LV Thrombus: ECHO with lumison ___ showed large (2.3 x 0.9 cm) mural thrombus along the apical inferior left ventricular wall. ___ new HFrEF. Started on warfarin 5 mg and Enoxaparin 80 mg q12h ___. Goal INR 2.0-3.0 Continue enoxaparin until 2 therapeutic INRs as an outpatient. She will need at least ___ months of anticoagulation and follow up TTE/CMR to assess for resolution of the LV thrombus. # Transaminitis: ALT elevated to 56 on admission, previously normal. Likely congestive hepatopathy in setting of HFrEF. Resolved with diuresis. # ?Asthma: Continued home fluticasone inh BID, alb neb PRN =========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - New Meds: Lovenox, warfarin, metoprolol succinate, lisinopril, furosemide - Post-Discharge Follow-up Labs Needed: INR within 2 days, Chem 10 within ___ weeks to check Cr - Discharge weight: 80.2 kg - Discharge diuretic: Furosemide 20 mg daily - New HFrEF: Unclear etiology, likely non-ischemic. Will need LHC down the road but deferred for now given LV thrombus. Should have cardiac MR as ___. Should consider ICD vs CRT given prolonged QRS if EF does not recover. - Diuresis: Pt was euvolemic on discharge at weight above. Will need evaluation within 7 days to determine need for adjusting diuretic. - Lisinopril: Pt developed cough after initiating lisinopril. If persists, could consider ___ - LV thrombus: D/c on warfarin 5 mg and enoxaparin 80 q12h - Iron deficiency: Ferritin 75.

Ms. ___ was admitted to the neurology service on ___ due to numbness in her perineal area. Her initial neurologic exam demonstrated a mild decrease in pinprick sensation in the S5 dermatome but was otherwise intact. By the next morning she had no objective sensory loss and rectal tone was normal. MRI L spine was performed which showed multiple focal areas of abnormal signal intensity and a single focus of abnormal enhancement in the lower thoracic cord, consistent with her prior imaging from ___ and consistent with her known diagnosis of MS. ___ has just received a course of IV steroids and is due to start Copaxone therapy. Given her mild and improving symptoms with no loss of bladder/bowel function and little to no objective findings on exam, she does not warrant further acute steroid treatment at this time. We advised her to start Copaxone as planned (insurance approval is currently pending), and to follow up with Dr. ___ in clinic as advised by her PCP. She was discharged home in good condition on ___. She has a follow-up appointment scheduled with Dr. ___ ___.           2072            221"

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

for close monitoring. He was started on Decadron and dilantin. An MRI was obtained to further characterize the lesion. A staging CT of the torso was obtained which showed metastasis to the lungs, left hilum, and spine. He was hydrated with bicarb fluids and given Mucomyst for renal protection prior to the CT scans. On HD#2 he was transferred to the neuro step down unit. A WAND study was obtained for image guidance of the resection. He was taken to the OR for resection of the brain mass on HD#5. He tolerated the procedure well and initially recovered in the PACU. He was extubated in the PACU without difficulty. He was then transferred to the neurosurgery step down unit. On POD#1 a repeat MRI was obtained which showed no bleeding. He was then transferred to the floor. On POD#2 his diet was advanced, his Foley was removed and he was seen by ___. His Decadron was weaned to 2 mg TID. He was seen by oncology and radiation oncology who recommended follow up in the brain tumor clinic and the ___ clinic. These appointments were set up for the patient. His antibiotics were stopped on POD#4. On POD#5 he was tolerating a regular diet, he had had a bowel movement, he was voiding without difficulty and he was cleared by ___ for home. He was discharged home with follow up instructions. \n",

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. &lt;FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS&gt; ___ &lt;DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS&gt; You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is &gt; maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.</td>\n",

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP &amp; LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone.

No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging.                                                                                                                          Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed \"hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm\" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is > maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.           3496           1143                        The patient was admitted with worsening back pain and underwent imaging studies that revealed metastatic breast cancer with thoracic spine involvement.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection and you were treated with antibiotics. You had an MRI of your head which did not show signs of a new stroke. You also had a bone biopsy of your skull which did not show signs of an infection. You had EEGs to monitor for seizures which did not show any seizure activity, but you were started on a new anti-seizure medicine. You had a PET body scan which showed infection of the prostate. You will likely need a prolonged course of antibiotics (about 12 weeks). Please follow up with your appointments listed below. You will need to follow up with heme/onc, infectious disease, neurology, and neurosurgery. Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. Sincerely, Your ___ Team   Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ Ph+ve ALL on dasatanib and IT MTX (cycle 9, last day ___ with a history of intracranial abscess/osteomyelitis and prolonged course of abx who presents with fever and altered mental status. # Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with fevers and altered mental status. Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] Continue PO ciprofloxacin and doxycycline for a prolonged course (likely 12 weeks) for treatment of prostatitis ___ of cipro, ___ of doxy). Last day ___.

On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing Hysteropexy (using Elevate system from AMS), posterior colporrhaphy, insertion of biologic graft in the posterior compartment. Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with Iv dilaudid and toradol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her foley was removed and a formal voiding trial was performed. She passed her voiding trial with the following values: 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 50cc straight catheterized; 300cc instilled, 250cc voided, 80cc bladder scanned. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to percocet and motrin. By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.           1119            221                                                                                                                        The patient underwent surgery for uterine prolapse and rectocele due to metastatic breast cancer.
