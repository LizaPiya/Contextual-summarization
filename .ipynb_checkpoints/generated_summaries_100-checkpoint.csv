Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. ","Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with CAD with prior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic insufficiency, who presented with painless jaundice. RUQ ultrasound showed pancreatic mass and LFTs were elevated in obstructive pattern, so he was admitted for ERCP and EUS. ERCP/EUS did not show stones or a mass, though did have 2cm CBD stricture with sphincterotomy. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # POSSIBLE PANCREATIC MASS # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION # PAINLESS JAUNDICE # CHOLELITHIASIS: RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed ""hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm"" and marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to obstruction at pancreatic head. These findings were concerning for malignancy, so he underwent ERCP and EUS on ___. ERCP showed no mass or stone, with 2cm CBD stricture and he had stent placement and sphincterotomy. EUS showed hypoechoic pancreas with areas of stranding, mild atrophy of tail, and pancreatic duct cut off at pancreatic head. Biopsy was taken of pancreatic head, but no distinct lesion or mass was seen. CT pancreas protocol was obtained, which also showed no discrete pancreatic mass, though showed a 1cm area within pancreatic head where pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of upstream pancreatic duct (3mm). This corresponded with the transition point seen on EUS and isodense lesion is still a possibility. Intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation was improved compared to RUQ ultrasound, after CBD stent placement. He had mild-moderate LUQ abdominal pain the evening after ERCP but improved and he was tolerating regular diet prior to discharge. Repeat LFTs were trending down after stent placement. His pain was managed with PRN Tylenol, oxycodone, IV morphine for pain and discharged with PRN Tylenol and oxycodone. ERCP team said that in absence of pancreatic mass, his EUS findings may be consistent with chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis. # CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Continued home Creon TID with meals # ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM: AAA was 4.6cm in ___ and 5.4cm on ultrasound on ___. He also has bilateral iliac artery aneurysms up to 3.1cm on right and 2.8cm on left. He was asymptomatic without concern for rupture. I had recommended outpatient follow up with vascular surgery, but anesthesia was concerned about AAA prior to ERCP/EUS and wanted vascular consult. Ultimately, there was no intervention needed prior to ERCP/EUS, but discussed with vascular and recommended CTA torso for better comparison with size in ___. CTA torso showed stable 4.6cm AAA with no dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. # HYPONATREMIA (RESOLVED): Na was 132 on admission and most likely to poor oral intake prior to admission. He received IV fluids and Na was 139 on discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin QPM # TOBACCO USE: He was encouraged to pursue tobacco cessation and given daily nicotine patch, though it sounds as though this was not previously covered by insurance. # ANXIETY: Continued home Bupropion BID, Lexapro (dose is > maximum 10 mg daily but pt confirms that he takes 20 at home), Prazosin, Gabapentin, PRN Trazodone QHS. # CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy: Asymptomatic - Continue home aspirin 81mg daily, Lisinopril 5mg daily # HTN: Continue home Lisinopril but held home Metoprolol XL since HR was in ___. # PRESUMED GERD: Continued PPI especially if he is taking NSAIDS prior to admission. # History of alcohol abuse: He had no signs of withdrawal. He was continued on multivitamin and thiamine daily. # Anemia: Hb was 13.2 and decreased to 11.5 without signs of blood loss and no hypotension. Of note, all cell counts decreased and likely in setting of receiving IV fluids. Hb decreased to 10.4 on discharge without signs of bleeding. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Follow up CBD brushings and biopsy from pancreatic head, which are pending - Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation. ERCP office will schedule follow up appointment - Follow up pending ___ level - Vascular surgery recommended repeat CTA abd/pelvis and clinic visit in 6 months. Call to schedule appointment in ___. - Monitor CBC to make sure anemia does not progressively worsen - Determine if/when to restart Metoprolol XL, which was held due to bradycardia (asymptomatic). Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.

Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation secondary to obstruction of at the level of the pancreatic head. A hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head measures approximately 4.7 x 3.0 x 3.3 cm and is concerning for malignancy. 2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination. 3. Interval increase in size in the known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.4 cm, previously 4.6 cm. 4. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 3.1 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left. 5. Mild splenomegaly. 6. Cholelithiasis. EUS ___: Successful upper EUS evaluation. The pancreatic parenchyma was noted to be hypoechoic with areas of stranding and mild atrophy of the tail. No distinct mass was seen, although PD cuts off towards the head of the pancreas and FNB was obtained. ERCP ___: Successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Sphincterotomy was performed due to concern for choledocholithiasis. On cholangiogram, there was a 2cm distal CBD stricture and no filling defects were seen. Biliary brushing were obtained and a stent deployed across the stricture. After stent deployment, there was excellent drainage of contrast and bile. CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS, WITH CT PANCREAS PROTOCOL ___: 1. No discrete pancreatic mass is seen on CT, however, there is a 1 cm area within the pancreatic head where the pancreatic duct is not visualized, with mild prominence of the upstream pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm. This corresponds to the transition point seen on the recent endoscopic ultrasound and an underlying isodense lesion remains a possibility. There is no extra-pancreatic tumor or peripancreatic stranding. No distal abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy detected. 2. Moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilation appears improved since the ultrasound from ___, following interval CBD stent placement. 3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.6 cm. No dissection or flow-limiting stenosis. 4. Bilateral aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries, measuring up to 2.4 cm on the left and 2.3 cm on the right. 5. Cholelithiasis. 6.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were hospitalized with jaundice and initial ultrasound was concerning for a pancreatic head mass. You had an ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound performed by GI doctors. ___ placed a stent in your common bile duct where there was narrowing to keep it open and did a sphincterotomy. This should relieve obstruction in your bile duct. The endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan did not show any distinct pancreatic mass. Biopsy was taken during the procedure and will take time to result, so this can be followed up with the GI doctors. The ultrasound initially was concerning for increased size of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a CT scan was performed, which is a more accurate test and showed it was 4.6cm, which is the same size that it was in ___. This is reassuring. You should continue to have periodic imaging of the aneurysm to make sure it is not significantly enlarging. 
Target: The patient was admitted to oncology for worsening back pain. Imaging revealed metastatic cancer with thoracic spine involvement. She was started on pain management and referred for palliative radiation therapy.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection and you were treated with antibiotics. You had an MRI of your head which did not show signs of a new stroke. You also had a bone biopsy of your skull which did not show signs of an infection. You had EEGs to monitor for seizures which did not show any seizure activity, but you were started on a new anti-seizure medicine. You had a PET body scan which showed infection of the prostate. You will likely need a prolonged course of antibiotics (about 12 weeks). Please follow up with your appointments listed below. You will need to follow up with heme/onc, infectious disease, neurology, and neurosurgery. Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. Sincerely, Your ___ Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ Ph+ve ALL on dasatanib and IT MTX (cycle 9, last day ___ with a history of intracranial abscess/osteomyelitis and prolonged course of abx who presents with fever and altered mental status. # Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with fevers and altered mental status. Given history of CNS instrumentation (s/p craniectomy/ embolization/ cranioplasty) and intracranial abscess with bone biopsy showing Mycobacterium fortuitum s/p 10 weeks of IV vancomycin, an LP was performed which was negative for meningitis. MRI of the head showed similar post-surgical processes as previous MRI with no acute intracranial abnormalities. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and was started on cefepime/vancomycin, later switched to cipro. Patient underwent parietal bone biopsy by neurosurgery on ___ to rule out osteomyelitis, which showed no bacterial growth and no evidence of osteomyelitis. Blood, CSF, and subsequent urine cultures were negative. On ___, due to concern for persistent AMS, neurology was consulted and blood/urine cx re-drawn. Patient underwent spot EEG, showing no seizures but frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions therefore keppra was increased to 1500 BID. A 24-hour video EEG was performed which showed focal slowing on right consistent with focal dysfunction, but without epileptiform changes or seizure activity. Patient was started on zonisamide and keppra was decreased to 750mg BID on ___ and stopped on ___. The zonisamide was started given concern for alterations in mood associated with keppra. His home trazadone, risperidone and escitalopram had originally been held on admission but were then restarted. The patient's mental status gradually improved and he was altered and oriented x 3 on discharge. He remained slow to respond to questions but able to answer questions appropriately. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and deemed stable to go home with services. His family members were trained in the kind of care and assistance that he would require and it was determined that he was safe for a discharge to home with home services and close monitoring. # History of mycobacterium fortuitum: Patient is s/p parietal bone biopsy ___, as above. As there was no mycobacterium grown in culture and no evidence of osteomyelitis, per ID the patient was maintained on ciprofloxacin with the addition of doxycycline with plan for 12 week course. # Prostatitis: Due to concern for occult infection given elevated CRP to 174 and thrombocytosis, patient underwent full-body PET scan ___ which showed increased FDG avidity in the prostate, concerning for prostatitis. Etiology could be from indwelling foley vs. from UTI. The patient's foley catheter was removed and he was able to void without difficulty. He was maintained on ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, as above, and will need a prolonged course (12 weeks). # Depression: On admission patient was initially started back on home escitalopram, risperidone, and trazodone; however due to concerns for AMS these agents were held during hospital stay. On ___ all three were restarted, as above. # Right humeral abnormality: PET scan noted increased uptake in posterior portion of distal right humerus with concern for occult trauma. A follow-up x-ray was obtained, which showed irregular left clavicle (indicative of prior trauma), cannot r/o soft tissue abnormality. The patient demonstrated no tenderness to palpation on physical exam and had no pain and so this was monitored without further issue. # Thrush: The patient was noted to have thrush ___, started fluconazole. He received a ___nd this was subsequently discontinued. # ALL: Patient last recieved IT MTX on ___. He was maintained on dasatanib 70 mg BID. For prophylaxis he was continued on atovaquone and switched to Bactrim given difficulty tolerating atovarquone. Acyclovir was substituted for home famciclovir while in the hospital. # DVT hx: The patient has a history of DVT and was continued on home enoxaparin 60mg q24h.

In comparison with the most recent examination, again postsurgical changes are seen, consistent with right parietal craniotomy and craniectomy, persistent moderate pattern of enhancement along the right temporal bone. 2. Overall no significant changes are demonstrated, there is unchanged encephalomalacia along the right frontal lobe, right insula, with ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles and moderate pattern of enhancement in the right insula and along the right MCA distribution, consistent with sequela of posttreatment changes. 3. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes or abscess formation. ___: BONE FRAGMENT(S), OTHER THAN PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE FINAL READ PENDING ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave epileptiform discharges originating in the right central and temporal regions, which at times appear in periodic runs of ___ Hz, but they do not evolve to suggest electrographic seizures. These findings indicate highly epileptogenic cortex in these regions. Additionally, in the same region, there is continuous focal slowing, indicative of a structural lesion, causing subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with overriding faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is indicative of a breach rhythm and may be compatible with the patient's history of a craniotomy. Over the left hemisphere, there is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology but may be due to various causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or infections. There are no electrographic seizures. ___ TUMOR IMAGING (PET- IMPRESSION: 1. Increased FDG avidity within the prostate, concerning for acute prostatitis. 2. Surgical changes involving the right parietal bone with increased heterogeneous FDG avidity in the right scalp which could relate to recent surgery, but for which an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Focus of low level FDG uptake at the distal right humerus posteriorly, possibly traumatic; however, correlation with physical examination advised. ___ (AP & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: No focal lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen. There is irregularity of the lateral clavicle suggestive of previous trauma. In the region of the soft tissue uptake in the posterior elbow on the prior PET scan, no definitive lesion is seen. The nodular area of uptake appears to be within the triceps tendon or muscle. Findings could be related to muscle strain although an underlying soft tissue lesion is not excluded. If there is persistent pain, this could be further evaluated with MRI. ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing, non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. ___ Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video ICU EEG monitoring study because of (1) focal slowing and a relative attenuation of faster frequencies on the right consistent with focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction. Higher voltages and sharper features in the same region are consistent with the patient's known neurosurgical breach. (2) Mild generalized background slowing which is non-specific with regards to etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There are no pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change. ___ Imaging RENAL U.S. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm. The left kidney measures 10.8 cm. Arising from the midpole of the right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 2.1 cm cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm simple cyst. Arising from the upper pole of the left kidney is an oval 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm simple cyst. No concerning solid masses are detected. There is no hydronephrosis. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple renal cysts.

He had a colonoscopy in ___ of this year where a large polyp that was unable to be extracted by endoscope was found by Dr. ___. He was referred to Dr. ___ surgical resection of the polyp. Per last clinic note by Dr. ___: It has been 2 months since I last saw Mr. ___ for his ___ hernia and a month since he underwent colonoscopy with identification of a low-grade cancer proximal to his end colostomy. Since he is last seen there are no changes in his health and well-being. He has no new complaints. He is here to discuss removal of the cancer and management of his large ___ hernia. I discussed with him in detail the findings from Dr. ___ ___ and the pathology report as well as multiple polyps that he has currently and the issue that he generated a cancer in the ___ years since his last colonoscopy. I made out a plan for him by which she would undergo completion colectomy via a midline incision with removal of his previous colostomy and creation of a new ileostomy reinforced with mesh. Also with resultant repair of the stomal hernia where his previous colostomy will have been. I plan to do this in conjunction with Dr. ___ of plastic surgery. He and I and his wife discussed the risks benefits and potential outcomes of a variety of surgical options but they agree that this would be the best option. I plan to have him see Dr. ___ at his earliest convenience, hopefully very soon since he has had some difficulty getting to appointments quickly. In addition I have asked him to check in with his primary care doctor and his cardiologist for medical clearance. He recently had an abdominal CT for other reasons that did not demonstrate any metastatic disease to the liver but he does still need a chest CAT scan as part of routine staging for this new finding. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -Atrial fibrillation, currently not on home Xarelto -Hypertension -Rectal cancer status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation (___) -Hip replacement ___ -Knee replacement ___ <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> His mother had a stroke in her elderly years.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. Stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where water is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. However, the output from your stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) will be watery because it is coming from the small intestine which means the water is not reabsorbed by the colon. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If ___ find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office.

The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for any bulging or signs of infection listed above. ___ will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic ___ weeks after surgery. Please call the ostomy nurses clinic number which is listed in the ileostomy/colostomy handout packet given to ___ by the nursing staff. ___ will also have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks to help to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own. Follow-up: 1. ___ will need to follow up with both General surgery and Plastic surgery. 2. ___ will need to follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks, so he can determine which of your home blood pressure medications that ___ should resume. 3. ___ will need an spleen ultra-sound in 3 months to evaluate lesions found on your spleen. Our hope is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual activities. Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care! ","Mr. ___ is a ___ who underwent an exploratory laparotomy in conjunction with abdominal wall reconstruction and completion colectomy and end ileostomy. He was initially admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ however was transferred to ___ on ___. Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake on, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and monitored for afib with telemetry. Course was notable for multiple bouts of tachycardia (Afib RVR) associated with physical activity with HR in the 130s-150s. BP remained stable during these episodes and tachycardia self-resolved with rest. This improved with continued physical therapy and initiation of home beta blocker (IV metoprolol when NPO, then PO atenolol). Patient was restarted on home atenolol for rate control and rivaroxaban for AC. Patient also with a longstanding history of hypertension. He was continued on a clonidine patch inpatient but home amlodipine, lisinopril, and furosemide were held due to normotension. Patient will follow up with PCP prior to restarting. Pulmonary: The patient has history of asthma and was started on home asthma medications or substitutes. Patient fairly non-compliant with use of CPAP which was available. GI/GU: #Ileus: On POD patient was kept NPO and started on IVF. He was advanced to sips on POD#2 and then to clear liquids on POD#3. Foley was maintained until POD#2 and then discontinued. Patient able to void freely. On POD#4, ostomy continued without flatus or output and abdomen appeared distended. KUB revealed some dilated bowel loops and probable ileus. Foley catheter was placed in ostomy with small liquid stool and gas output. In addition, urine output was noted to be marginal so patient was given albumin for concern for intravascular dehydration. POD#5 showed good stoma function with stoma catheter in place and patient was advanced to a regular diet. On POD#6, the stoma catheter was discontinued. Patient had no ostomy output and very poor urine output on POD#7. He was also noted to have nausea and a distended abdomen. KUB revealed ileus and gastroparesis. Ostomy stoma was catheterized again and an NG tube was placed with immediate output of 3 liters of green fluid. Patient was made NPO and placed back on IV fluids. On ___ the NGT fell out but was replaced. Due to continued poor output from the ostomy, on ___/P was ordered which was consistent with post-surgical changes and no evidence of a leak. The NGT was ultimately discontinued on ___. Diet was advanced to sips on ___ and clears on ___. Patient received a dose of reglan and the ostomy had high output of almost 3L on ___. He received 12.5g of 25% albumin to replace the high output. A PICC line was placed by ___ on ___ and patient was given TPN ___. A regular diet was started on ___, which was well tolerated. Prevena vac and JP drain (if <25cc/day) were to be removed prior to discharge. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine steadily increased during immediate post-operative course from 1.8 post op to at peak 2.0, though continued to make adequate urine throughout. Cr normalized with continued mIVF. Prior to CT a/p he did receive 25gm 5% albumin for pre-hydration. On day of discharge, BUN/Cr ___. ID: The patient was closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and fever. Heme: The patient had blood levels checked daily during their hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding.

IMAGING: ___ CT A/P LOWER CHEST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Large calcified granulomas noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 3.9 cm hypoenhancing lesion in segment ___ is unchanged from prior and likely represents a simple cyst. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: There is a 7.5 x 8.6 cm heterogeneous lesion with minimal enhancement (when compared to the sure start series) in the anterior peripheral aspect of the spleen, new from exam in ___. There are additional hypodense lesions in the spleen (e.g. 05: 26 and 05: 30). Supple area of hyperenhancement and a peripheral posterior aspect of the spleen (05: 24) is unchanged from exam in ___. ADRENALS: Right adrenal gland is unremarkable. 1.9 cm nodule arising from the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland is unchanged in size compared to exam in ___. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Simple cysts are seen throughout the left kidney measuring up to 4.2 cm in the interpolar region. GASTROINTESTINAL: Stomach is unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates within. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid is noted. Status post total colectomy. End ileostomy is noted in the right lower quadrant. Oral contrast extends to the level of distal small bowel loops in the pelvis. No extraluminal contrast to suggest leak although contrast does not extend to the level of the ostomy. PELVIS: Bladder is decompressed and not well seen secondary to streak artifact from adjacent right hip prosthesis. Stranding and soft tissue thickening in the presacral area is presumably postsurgical. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate and seminal vesicles are poorly evaluated secondary to artifact from right hip prosthesis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Status post total right hip arthroplasty. SOFT TISSUES: Right lower quadrant ileostomy is noted. There is soft tissue stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A drain approaching from the right lower quadrant is seen in this location, however no fluid collections are seen. Small foci of subcutaneous air in this location may be related to the drain placement. Hernia repair material seen along the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post total colectomy with end ileostomy. No evidence of obstruction or leak, although oral contrast does not extend to the level of the ileostomy. 2. New 8.6 cm heterogeneous splenic lesion may represent a hematoma, although metastasis should be considered given cancer history. Further initial evaluation with ultrasound in a few days is recommended. 3. Subcutaneous stranding and edema of the rectus musculature in the left lower quadrant is presumably postsurgical. A right lower quadrant approach drain is seen terminating in this region. There is no associated fluid collection. 4. Small volume mesenteric free-fluid possibly postsurgical. 5. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. RECOMMENDATION(S): Splenic ultrasound ___ SPLEEN ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.2 cm. The largest lesion in the anterior spleen measures up to 9.2 x 8.1 x 9.1 cm with heterogeneous internal signal and no internal vascularity suggestive of hematoma. Smaller lesions also seen on the prior CT measure 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm and 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. These are more homogeneously hyperechoic and avascular with good through transmission. KIDNEYS: Limited images of the left kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The dominant splenic lesion seen on recent prior CT most likely represents a hematoma. 2. Smaller homogeneously hyperechoic lesions may represent additional small hematomas or small hemangiomas. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow-up splenic ultrasound in 3 months is recommended. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Albuteral ___ puff Q6H prn wheezes allopurinol ___ po daily amlodipine 10 mg po daily atenolol 100 mg po daily symbicort clonidine 0.1 mg po daily furosemide 40 mg po daily potassium ER 20 meq po daily xarelto 20mg po daily Tylenol prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

You were put on prednisone and resumed your inhalers and breathing treatments and are slowly improving. You are being discharged to rehab. Please make sure that you are able to obtain your necessary medicines at home. ","Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of severe COPD on home O2 presenting with respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation. #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and tachycardia, and subjective fevers of unknown cause, consistent with mild COPD exacerbation. She notably denied cough, sputum production, or upper respiratory symptoms concerning for a typical or more severe COPD flare. Furthermore, since she had been off of an inhaler anticholinergic and oral prednisone for the 2 weeks prior to presentation, her symptoms may simply be the result of severe under-treated COPD. She had already received doses of azithromycin and methylprednisolone in the ED. On arrival to the ICU initially she was comfortable and maintained adequate SPO2 on 4L NC, which is her home oxygen requirement. She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6h standing, and albuterol nebulizer Q2H PRN dyspnea. She received methylprednisolone 80mg IV q8H x 24 hours, which was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily which will be tapered slowly with the guidance of her pulmonologist. She was found to be tachycardic on the medical floor so she was changed to xopenex nebs. She should continue her home azithromycin on discharge. #ANXIETY: continued home escitalopram and lorazepam #HYPERTENSION: continued home verapamil and furosemide #OSTEOPOROSIS: continued home vitamin D Transitional issues: - this COPD exacerbation appears to have been provoked by stopping Spiriva, and changing Symbicort to mometasone/formeterol. On discharge from rehab will need to clarify if patient is able to obtain meds at home. - Please taper prednisone by 10mg qweekly ",2132,416,"Input: <SEX> F <SERVICE> ONCOLOGY <CHIEF COMPLAINT> worsening back pain <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presenting with worsening back pain over the last two weeks.

FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

The patient explains she was in her usual state of health one day prior to admission, and enjoyed a ""long"" swim on ___. Following her swim she recalls napping for two hours and awakening feeling well. However, she thereafter noted the gradual onset of ""discomfort"" limited to the ""skull"" behind her right ear. She describes the discomfort as ""dull"" and rating ___ on a 10-point pain scale at its worst. She denies radiation of the discomfort. She denies identifiable triggers and exacerbating factors. She denies associated symptoms including phono- and photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck discomfort, changes in vision, and ear discomfort. She did not treat the HA or mention alleviating factors. She recalls going to bed as usual and falling to sleep without difficulty. She indicates her headache must have ""disappeared"" in the course of her sleep because she awakened feeling her usual self at a customary time between ___. The pt describes enjoying a ""lazy"" holiday morning. She recalls preparing breakfast while standing upright between 10: 30 and 11am. At that time, she describes ""stretching"" by fully extending her neck. In the midst of the maneuver, she states she developed an acute sense of ""severe sea-sickness,"" requiring her to hold on to the nearby oven for support. She says she had diarrhea within about three minutes of the symptom, and had to crawl to the bathroom because attempts to walk resulted in the persistent feeling that she would fall to the right. Other associated symptoms included nausea, although the pt denies vomiting. Following the episode of diarrhea, she assumed a supine position. She says that lying still ""with no movement"" seemed to decrease the intensity of the feeling of sea-sickness. She denies similar episodes in the past. The sx prompted her to call her PCP, who recommended she go to the ED for evaluation. The pt initially presented to the ___ by ambulance. The pt recalls the persistence of sea-sickness and nausea for about ___ hours until she was given an IV (which she thinks provided NS). This examiner could not elucidate from the available notes what treatment was given. The pt recalls a transient (~30 minute episode) of ""blurred vision"" while at ___ which she said spontaneously resolved. Notes suggest that the physicians at the OSH noted ""faint fatiguing nystagmus to the right"" and inferior visual field cuts. Reportedly, the laboratory studies, EKG, and CT performed at the outside hospital were normal or negative. She was subsequently transferred to the ___ for evaluation. En route by ambulance, the pt developed a headache in the occipital regions bilaterally. She recalls a gradual onset of non-radiating discomfort that rated ___ at its worst; she could not define the time from onset to peak discomfort. Since that time, she notes that the headache has moved to the temporal regions bilaterally and is much improved; she rates the discomfort as ___. She attributes the discomfort to ""not eating"" all day. At the time of evaluation, the pt reports feeling herself. She denies a sense of sea-sickness and nausea. She indicates her vision has completely normalized. Although she continues to experience slight bi-temporal ""dull"" discomfort, she indicates the sx is unlike her prior migraines. She denies any migraines for the ___ yrs PTA. On neurological review of systems, the pt specifically denies experiencing the ""room spinning around"" her and the sense that she might lose consciousness. Rather, she volunteers having felt as though she ""might fall"" from lack of balance. She denies neck pain. Of note, the pt recalls recent redecoration activities and describes herself as a ___. While she does recall assuming a position in which she extended her neck to paint the ceiling, she notes in was a ""long time ago."" She does note a ~1month hx of second-long episodes of left ___ discomfort. She indicates it feels as though she is ""punched in the eye."" She recalls 1 episode every ___ days. She denies associated tearing, congestion, and HA; the sx spontaneously resolves. General review of systems is positive for an URI in the 2 weeks prior to admission that included ""sinus sx,"" maximum temperature of ___ F, and sore throat. She denies associated ear discomfort and hearing difficulty. She treated the URI with ""homeopathic"" remedies and states she was feeling better by one week PTA.

The patient explains she was in her usual state of health one day prior to admission, and enjoyed a ""long"" swim on ___. Following her swim she recalls napping for two hours and awakening feeling well. However, she thereafter noted the gradual onset of ""discomfort"" limited to the ""skull"" behind her right ear. She describes the discomfort as ""dull"" and rating ___ on a 10-point pain scale at its worst. She denies radiation of the discomfort. She denies identifiable triggers and exacerbating factors. She denies associated symptoms including phono- and photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck discomfort, changes in vision, and ear discomfort. She did not treat the HA or mention alleviating factors. She recalls going to bed as usual and falling to sleep without difficulty. She indicates her headache must have ""disappeared"" in the course of her sleep because she awakened feeling her usual self at a customary time between ___. The pt describes enjoying a ""lazy"" holiday morning. She recalls preparing breakfast while standing upright between 10: 30 and 11am. At that time, she describes ""stretching"" by fully extending her neck. In the midst of the maneuver, she states she developed an acute sense of ""severe sea-sickness,"" requiring her to hold on to the nearby oven for support. She says she had diarrhea within about three minutes of the symptom, and had to crawl to the bathroom because attempts to walk resulted in the persistent feeling that she would fall to the right. Other associated symptoms included nausea, although the pt denies vomiting. Following the episode of diarrhea, she assumed a supine position. She says that lying still ""with no movement"" seemed to decrease the intensity of the feeling of sea-sickness. She denies similar episodes in the past. The sx prompted her to call her PCP, who recommended she go to the ED for evaluation. The pt initially presented to the ___ by ambulance. The pt recalls the persistence of sea-sickness and nausea for about ___ hours until she was given an IV (which she thinks provided NS). This examiner could not elucidate from the available notes what treatment was given. The pt recalls a transient (~30 minute episode) of ""blurred vision"" while at ___ which she said spontaneously resolved. Notes suggest that the physicians at the OSH noted ""faint fatiguing nystagmus to the right"" and inferior visual field cuts. Reportedly, the laboratory studies, EKG, and CT performed at the outside hospital were normal or negative. She was subsequently transferred to the ___ for evaluation. En route by ambulance, the pt developed a headache in the occipital regions bilaterally. She recalls a gradual onset of non-radiating discomfort that rated ___ at its worst; she could not define the time from onset to peak discomfort. Since that time, she notes that the headache has moved to the temporal regions bilaterally and is much improved; she rates the discomfort as ___. She attributes the discomfort to ""not eating"" all day. At the time of evaluation, the pt reports feeling herself. She denies a sense of sea-sickness and nausea. She indicates her vision has completely normalized. Although she continues to experience slight bi-temporal ""dull"" discomfort, she indicates the sx is unlike her prior migraines. She denies any migraines for the ___ yrs PTA. On neurological review of systems, the pt specifically denies experiencing the ""room spinning around"" her and the sense that she might lose consciousness. Rather, she volunteers having felt as though she ""might fall"" from lack of balance. She denies neck pain. Of note, the pt recalls recent redecoration activities and describes herself as a ___.

Until you INR level is therapeutic, you should continue to take Lovenox injections twice daily as you have been doing in the hospital. You will have your bloodwork checked on ___. You will follow with your PCP and Dr. ___ at the dates/times below. We have made the following changes to your medications: - Take Lovenox injections (110mg) at 8am and 8pm every day until your INR is ___ - Take Coumadin 10mg daily and get your INR level measured frequently - Continue the rest of your home medications ","Pt is ___ yo M with hx of of prior silent MI, HTN, HLD, transitional cell carcinoma (s/p radiation, no surgery or chemo) who p/w LLE edema and swelling . # DVT: Given the patient's history of bladder cancer and radiation within the past year, his LLE edema was most consistent on presentation with lymphatic obstruction, either from reseeding of the lymphatic bed with tumor or direct damage from radiation. However, the patient's pain on hip flexion, tenderness in the left hip, and acute onset suggested DVT. LENIs were negative, suggesting a more proximal DVT. He was started on a heparin drip on admission. CT abd/pelvis the following day demonstrated a 2cm DVT in the left external iliac vein. The patient's heparin drip was continued, and he was started on 5mg coumadin. His INR remained subtherapeutic, and his coumadin was increased to 10mg. The patient initially refused to go home on Lovenox injections on account of his fear of needles but after several attempts at counseling, he agreed to administer his own Lovenox with the assistance of a home ___ until his INR became therapeutic. He was discharged with 110mg BID Lovenox injections, 10mg coumadin qdaily, and scheduled to follow-up with his PCP to manage his anticoagulation over the next 6 months. He should follow-up with oncology or his PCP regarding how long to continue on anticoagulation given that inciting cause of DVT was either malignancy or XRT and it is unclear whether the provoking agent can ever be considered removed. . # Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline Cr is 1.2 and was 1.3 on admission. Per the patient, he has been dehydrated the previous 2 days. His Cr remained at baseline after adequate IVF rehydration and was 1.2 upon discharge. . # Bladder CA - In-house CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence or metastatic spread of patient's previous bladder cancer. The patient was scheduled for routine surveillance CT in ___, and we have communicated with his radiation oncologist in order to cancel this study, if the in-house CT performed during this hospitalization is sufficient to rule out recurrence. . # HTN - The patient's blood pressure was well-controlled throughout his hospitalization on his home anti-hypertensives. . # Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on his home statin. . # S/p silent MI - Given the patient's history of silent MI, we have communicated with the patient's PCP regarding aspirin and ACE inhibitor therapy. He will follow-up with his PCP for further management of this condition. .

For a full detailed history of the patient's lung cancer, please see ___ note from ___. In brief, most recently in ___, the patient had a CT chest which showed a 1.3 x 1.0 cm right lower lobe lung nodule, increased from 1.0 x 0.4 cm, thought to be most likely bronchogenic carcinoma. On ___ the patient had a CT guided RFA of this lesion. The procedure was complicated by a small amount of hemorrhage, and a small pneumothorax, so a biopsy of the lesion was not obtained. Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ from ___ to ___ with respiratory failure after the RFA. She was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia. Her oxygenation improved and she was discharged to ___ in ___, where she stayed for two weeks. A follow up CT with contrast on ___ showed a cavitary nodule in the medial RLL significantly increased to 3.4 x 3.7 cm compared with 2.3 cm with central low density suggesting necrosis. The nodule abutted the esophagus and posterior pericardium without definite evidence of invasion. Given the location of the patient's lesion, it was not felt to be amenable to a wedge resection, but would rather require a basal segmentectomy. However, it was also thought to be amenable to CyberKnife SBRT which would require biopsy and fiducial marker placement. On ___, she underwent outpatient biopsy & fiducial placement of RLL lung mass. 4 core biopsy samples were sent for pathology, and 10cc of purulent fluid were sent for microbiology. A CT showed a small paramediastinal pneumothorax post-procedure, with follow up CXRs at 2 and 4 hours post procedure showing resolution of the PTX. Clinically, she has been stable on room air.

On exam patient has psychomotor retardation, a dysphoric affect and states that his mood is depressed. His admission labs were wnl and his chronic nausea has been extensively worked up without finding a source. It is possible that patient's nausea is a somatic delusion, especially with a negative extensive medical workup. Differential is depressive psychosis vs delusional do. Patient was continued on his home medications of clonazepam (1mg in AM and 0.5 in afternoon) and phenelzine 45mg BID. Ziprazodone was discontinued and 5mg of aripiprazole was started on ___. Aripiprazole was titrated to a dose of 7.5 on discharge and he tolerated it without side effects. Dr. ___ team was contacted and patient recieved ECT on ___, and ___ without reported side effects. Medical: #Chronic nausea- No acute issues, still with chronic nausea slightly improved with ECT. Continued home Prilosec 20 mg bid and Zantac 300 mg qhs. He was also given Zofran ODT 4mg bid PRN for nausea, although this did not help. #BPH- continued pt's home meds: tamsulosin 0.4 bid, Avodart 0.5 mg daily Collateral: Spoke with outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. ___. Dr. ___ has been treating patient since ___. Patient frequently makes SI comments that he wants to die because of his intractable nausea. However, patient has never acted on these urges/comments or been psychiatrically hospitalized. Psychiatrist says that he believes patient's nausea is associated with his depression. The nausea has been extensively worked up in past, both by gastroenterology and PCP, and has never revealed any pathology. Dr. ___ that nausea may be a manifestation of psychotic depression, and this is why he referred patient for ECT.

PCP has also done abdominal MRI, that did not reveal any pathology. She was considering referring him to GI again for furthur workup. PCP agrees that nausea seems linked with depression. PCP also said that in past patient has endorsed suicidal ideation, but he would say he had no intent to kill himself and he never had a plan. Risk Assessment: Patient is at moderate chronic risk of harm to self. Pt has no prior hospitalizations, SAs, family history of SA, no hx of impulsivity or substance use, and is help seeking. However, pt is also an unmarried white, elderly male living alone, has questionable reality testing ability, has frequent SI related to his intolerable and intractable nausea (and has hopelessness and anxiety regarding this), and has the means to act on his plan. It was reassuring to hear from the patient's psychiatrist and PCP, both say that patient's SI is a recurrent problem that is not new, suggesting that patient is at an elevated chronic risk to self, but his imminent risk is low/unchanged. While on Deaconness 4 patient's risk factors were modified by ECT therapy and change to aripiprazole for better cotnrol of both mood and delusions. He was encouraged to participate in outpatient psychotherapy. He reports that if he begins to feel worse he will go to the ___ 1 mile from his house.

","Mr. ___ was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service under Dr. ___ on ___ for pain control after a splenic artery embolization done by the Interventional Radiology service. He received PO Dilaudid and standing tylenol for pain control during his hospital stay. On the morning of ___, his Hct was 19.4, a repeat Hct was 18.6. He was given 2u pRBCs. A post-transfusion Hct was 22. He spiked to 102.7 for which he was pan-cultred. CXR was negative for pneumonia. IV Zosyn was started for empiric coverage. Right groin puncture site pain was persistent. U/S of the area identified a 2.5 cm partially thrombosed right groin pseudoaneurysm, with a neck measuring 3 mm in width. Hct decreased to 19 again. IV Vitamin K was given for INR of 2.9. An abdominal CT was also done demonstrating just ascites. Post CT, creatinine increased to 3.9. He was bloused with IV fluid for low urine output. ___ then embolized the pseudoaneurysm on ___. Postop, embolization, right groin appeared ecchymotic with positive distal pulses. He had less pain in the right groin. Hct was down to 17. Two units of PRBC were transfused with post hct of 23. Postop transfusion, he had an 8 beat run of VTach that resolved. Calcium repletion was given for calcium of 7.5. Hct stabilized at ___. LFTs were notable of rise in t.bili to 3.9. ERCP was done on to interrogate the metal stent on ___. It was noted that the previously placed metal stent had migrated, a CBD anastomotic stricture was noted and a new MS was placed. He tolerated this procedure well and diet was advanced to regular the next day. A repeat U/S of the groin was done on ___lood flow at the neck of the pseudoaneurysm which may represent a small arterial branch vessel. No documented flow within the body of the pseudoaneurysm. He continued to have discomfort at this site as well as abdominal and back pain for which he was receiving po Dilaudid. He was taking a total of ___ per day of the Dilaudid.

MRI/MRA/MRV brain was unremarkable, and the etiology of the pain was thought to be a combination of trigeminal neuralgia, temperomandibular joint disease, and migraine. The patient frequently demanded narcotics during her admission, reporting that ""nothing works except dilaudid (or IV medications)."" She was noted to complain of significantly more discomfort when medical personnel were in the room. There had apparently been some concern for drug-seeking behavior in the past. One-time doses of dilaudid 2mg were given several times when the patient complained of severe pain; she also received morphine and ativan due to pain and anxiety prior to her MRI. She was started on oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) for pain control of trigeminal neuralgia.

ACTIVE ISSUES =============== # Shortness of breath and leg swelling #Acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Clinical findings with patient presenting with new shortness of breath and increased ___ edema most consistent with new onset heart failure with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray. No evidence of infection. Reports of COPD on notes but unclear if accurate and appeared more consistent with volume overload. Received 20 mg of IV Lasix x2 while in ED observation with good urine output and significant improvement in both pulmonary symptoms and ___ edema but still with volume overload with plan to continue IV diuresis with 20 mg of IV Lasix until euvolemia. Had mild elevation of troponin from 0.03 to 0.04 x2 but negative CK-MB. EKG consistent with LBBB that was known per ___ records with no significant acute ST changes. TTE was performed on ___ that revealed a depressed EF of 40% (new per report but prior imaging not available for comparison) as well as mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD (LAD distribution), calcific aortic valve disease with minimal stenosis and mild regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, elevated intracardiac filling pressures and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Weight on ___ was 76 kg. Unclear patient baseline dry weight. Continued on home metop and losartan. Planned transfer to ___ cardiology service. It is unclear if pt's drop in LVEF is acute vs. subacute vs. chronic. Could consider medical management and assessment of symptoms vs. pharmacologic stress to determine degree of ischemia vs. cardiac catheterization to attempt revascularization. # Atrial Fibrillation with RVR No reports per patient or family of prior episode of afib. Received metoprolol 5mg IV in ED on ___, as well as fractionated metoprolol tartrate 25mg at that time with improvement. Elevated CHADS2 score such that patient should be anticoagulated. This was not initiated as pt may need procedure. Additionally, discussion with patient and family discussing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation should be addressed. # Weight Loss Poor PO intake ___ cognitive decline and less active. Low clinical suspicion for underlying malignancy. Needs nutritional education also given new heart failure. Touch base with outpatient PCP. Consider age appropriate cancer screening if within goals of care. CHRONIC ISSUES: ================ # T2DM Continued on Glargine 10 units daily with saxagliptin held while on insulin sliding scale. #Gout Continued on Allopurinol # Cognitive Dysfunction Continued Donepezil. Confused but at baseline mental status while here. # Unspecified Mood Disorder Continued buspirone and sertraline. Clarify with ___ records. # BPH: Continue finasteride # HTN: Continue metoprolol, losartan # OSA: Unclear if on CPAP. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ===================== [] Recommend continued cards input regarding whether medical management of new onset heart failure vs pursuing further diagnostic intervention with pharmacologic stress or possibly proceeding immediately to cath would be most ideal. Recommend comparison to prior ___ records and patient/families treatment goals. [] Will need to consider anticoagulation given afib and elevated CHADS2 [] Adjust metoprolol as needed for afib rate control [] Increase ongoing goal directed therapy given new HFrEF [] Continue to follow-up on weight loss [] Clarify on COPD history [] ___ evaluation while at the ___, social situation at home that may require assistance upon eventual discharge # CODE: Full (presumed) Pt's wife states they have never thought about this before. # CONTACT: ___ (wife): ___.

We believe your symptoms may have been secondary to a viral infection. We treated you with a medication called tamiflu for the flu. Additionally, you developed a rash on your left lower leg, which may have been an infection. We treated you with antibiotics, initially vancomycin, which was changed to cephalexin at the time of discharge. One sample of your blood from ___ grew Staph aureus, which was likely contamination from the blood draw. Regardless, it will be covered by your cephalexin. You should continue to get plenty of rest and drink fluids at home. See below for your follow-up appointments. Please see attached for an updated list of your medications. Wishing you all the best!

Patient had defervesced on arrival, but had one low-grade fever on HOD #3. Initially, he was treated empirically with Tamiflu for suspected influenza infection. After his DFA returned negative for flu on HOD #4, Tamiflu was discontinued. One blood culture from HOD #3 return positive for coagulase negative staph, but as all other blood cultures from this admission were negative, and patient was hemodynamically stable, this was most likely a contaminant. Additionally, he was noted to have a patchy erythematous rash on his left lower leg on HOD #3. Thus, he was started on vancomycin empirically for coverage of cellulitis. He continued vancomycin ___ at discharge; at that time, he was transitioned to cephalexin to complete a 7-day course of antibiotics for cellulitis. Although rash appeared atypical for cellulitis, it seemed to improve with antibiotics. ACE wraps were applied to legs, and legs were elevated, as patient reported similar afflication with venous stasis in the past. # Bacteremia: One blood culture from ___ grew coagulase-negative staph. Although this was likely just a contaminant (blood cultures from ___ and ___ without growth, it was covered by empiric antibiotics, as above. Patient will finish 7-day course of cephalexin as an outpatient. # LLE Rash / cellulitis: Unilateral, with patchy erythema that appeared atypical for cellulitis. LLE ultrasound was negative for DVT. In the setting of fevers, empiric vancomycin was started on ___ for coverage, and rash appeared to improve. Patient to complete 7-day course with cephalexin after discharge. ACE wraps were applied to legs, and legs were elevated, as patient reported similar afflication with venous stasis in the past. He was instructed to use compression stockings at home. His ultrasound did show an enlarged lymph node on the left side, c/w an underlying infectious/inflammatory process. CHRONIC ISSUES: #HTN: Stable.

We believe your symptoms may have been secondary to a viral infection. We treated you with a medication called tamiflu for the flu. Additionally, you developed a rash on your left lower leg, which may have been an infection. We treated you with antibiotics, initially vancomycin, which was changed to cephalexin at the time of discharge. One sample of your blood from ___ grew Staph aureus, which was likely contamination from the blood draw. Regardless, it will be covered by your cephalexin. You should continue to get plenty of rest and drink fluids at home. See below for your follow-up appointments. Please see attached for an updated list of your medications. Wishing you all the best!

After consulting the infectious disease and hematology specialists, we think that the most likely cause of your neutropenia is due to a medication effect. We have stopped Bactrim and are putting you on a different medication, atovaquone. We also decreased your mycophenolate dose to 750mg twice a day, because it too can cause neutropenia. Your counts recovered without any complications. We also had the endocrine specialists to come see you. They thought that you should be adequately treated for hypothyroidism on 75mcg of levothyroxine daily, which we will continue until you follow up with Dr. ___. Please weigh yourself every morning, and call Dr. ___ your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Also, take your medications as directed and keep all of your appointments. It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the ___! Sincerely, Your ___ Care Team ","SUMMARY: ___ with PMH of dilated cardiomyopathy ___ class IV s/p VAD/ICD placement ___ and subsequent OHT ___, newly diagnosed hypothyroidism, presented after routine labs discovered neutropenia. ACTIVE ISSUES # Neutropenia Unclear etiology but a concerning finding. Fortunately, the patient was asymptomatic and had no fevers. Multiple possibilities could be involved: too much immunesuppression from her regimen, an occult infection (no symptoms however), Bactrim toxicity (has been on it for some time though). Had positive urine culture no treatment needed given no symptoms. Hematology and ID were consulted. CMV/EBV viral load negative, flow cytometry negative for concerning clonal populations to suggest hematological malignancy. After stopping Bactrim and decreasing the dose of MMF from 1000mg BID to ___ BID, her ANC slowly recovered and was at 638 at discharge. Therefore, most likely explanation was Bactrim toxicity. Bone marrow biopsy was deferred given recovery. Filgrastim was not given due to no signs of infection. # Dilated Cardiomyopathy s/p OHT Patient endorsed shortness of breath that had been chronic and stable since transplant. She had only mild rejection on recent biopsy and appeared euvolemic. Her immunesuppression was modified to MMF 750mg BID from 1000mg BID. Prednisone was continued at 2.5mg daily. Tacrolimus levels were monitored every day, and due to persistent levels <7, her tacrolimus was increased to 3mg BID from 2mg in AM and 3mg in ___. Bactrim was stopped and atovaquone started at 1500mg daily for PCP and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis. Nystatin was continued. # Hypothyroidism Patient continued to be very symptomatic from her hypothyroidism despite recent increase in levothyroxine. However, TSH appeared to be lowering with increasing free T4. Endocrine recommended continuing current regimen as she had yet to reach steady-state yet. She continued to take levothyroxine 75mcg daily while inpatient. CHRONIC ISSUES # Compression Fractures: She received Tylenol and oxycodone PRN, and continued vitamin D and calcium supplementation. 24hr urine collection for calcium, creatinine, and UPEP were collected based on outpatient endocrine recommendations. # T2DM: Continued home insulin regimen. # GERD: Continued pantoprazole 40mg BID. # Anxiety: Continued sertraline 75mg daily and clonazepam 2.5mg QHS. # Anemia: Chronic but stable. Continued ferrous sulfate 325mg daily.

After consulting the infectious disease and hematology specialists, we think that the most likely cause of your neutropenia is due to a medication effect. We have stopped Bactrim and are putting you on a different medication, atovaquone. We also decreased your mycophenolate dose to 750mg twice a day, because it too can cause neutropenia. Your counts recovered without any complications. We also had the endocrine specialists to come see you. They thought that you should be adequately treated for hypothyroidism on 75mcg of levothyroxine daily, which we will continue until you follow up with Dr. ___. Please weigh yourself every morning, and call Dr. ___ your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Also, take your medications as directed and keep all of your appointments. It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the ___! Sincerely, Your ___ Care Team

Sincerely, Your ___ care team ","___ is a ___ female high school senior with PMH of Prader-Willi, ADHD, chronic migraine without auras, known 2mm R PCA aneurysm, hx Kawasaki's disease who presents with headache, fevers, myalgias, c/f meningitis vs severe migraine in setting of a concominant viral illness, with improving symptoms. # chills # myalgias # headache Initial concern for meningitis given chills, HA, and report of photophobia so started on empiric therapy with vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir in the ED after several failed attempts at LP. Her exam on the floor was notable for improving headache, without any evidence of nuchal rigidity, which was not felt to be suggestive of meningitis. Notably, she does have a 2 mm PCA aneurysm; however, given new onset, ""worst headache"" symptoms and family history of hemorrhagic stroke from aneurysm x2, obtained NCHCT on ___ that was within normal limits. Low suspicion of expanding PCA aneurysm, which would need to be worked up with CTA, because expansion would not be consistent with her systemic symptoms. ___ guided LP performed on ___ with CSF that was bland (1 WBC, 8 RBCs) and antibiotics/antivirals were stopped at that time. Given clear CSF without xanthochromia and only 8 RBCs, as well as negative head CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage felt to be ruled out. Other infectious workup, including CXR, UA, and flu swabs were negative. Some infectious studies, including respiratory viral panel, Lyme, serum anaplasma PCR, CSF HSV PCR, and CSF Arborvirus IgM and IgG, are pending at time of discharge. We think overall picture most consistent with a particularly severe migraine in setting of a concominant viral illness. For patient headache, pain at site of LP attempts, and myalgias, recommended ibuprofen PRN, tylenol, and lidocaine patch. # Migraines Continued home topiramate. # Depression Continued home citalopram. # Allergic rhinitis Continued home loratadine. #Nausea/vomiting Continued home Prochlorperazine 10 mg PO TID:PRN. #Insomnia Continued home HydrOXYzine 25 mg PO/NG QHS insomnia #Menses regulation Held home OCP because non-formulary. =================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== #stopped meds: none #changed meds: none #new meds: none [ ] please follow-up symptoms of chills, myalgias, and headache and ensure resolution [ ] please follow-up studies pending at time of discharge: respiratory viral panel, serum anaplasma PCR, CSF HSV PCR, and CSF Arborvirus IgM and IgG. # CODE: full # CONTACT: ___, Mother, ___ ",2802,618,"Input: <SEX> F <SERVICE> ONCOLOGY <CHIEF COMPLAINT> worsening back pain <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presenting with worsening back pain over the last two weeks.

Admission liver/gallbladder ultra-sound revealed multiple small gallstones at the gallbladder neck and mildly thickened gallbladder wall with a normal CBD consistent with acute cholecystitis versus chronic cholelithiasis. He was made NPO, started on IV fluids, and given Morphine IV PRN for pain. He was started on empiric IV Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. The patient underwent ERCP, which revealed three irregular stones in the distal CBD. A sphincterotomy and stone extraction were successfully performed. He was subsequently placed on aggressive IV fluid hydration and allowed clear liquids. . On ___, the patient then underwent laparoscopic exploration, extensive lysis of adhesions and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (see Operative Note). The patient was alos found to have chronic cholecystitis intra-operatively. After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, he was returned to the floor tolerating clears, on IV fluids, and received Dilaudid IV PRN for pain control. He remained hemodynamically stable. . Post-operative pain was adequately controlled with the Dilaudid IV PRN, which was converted to oral oxycodone when tolerating clear liquids. Due to inadequate pain control, the oxycodone was changed to Dilauid PO PRN and IV Toradol added with improved pain control. The patient tolerated clears on POD#0. Diet was advanced as to a regular diet by later that day with good tolerability. The patient voided normally. Laparoscopic incisions remained clean and intact. . During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. Labwork was routinely followed; electrolytes were repleted when indicated. . At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. He was discharged home without services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

You should continue to walk several times a day. - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as tolerated. - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common sense and go slowly at first. - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. - Continue to wear your abdominal binder. - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you otherwise. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: - You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during the surgery. YOUR BOWELS: - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. PAIN MANAGEMENT: - You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean off these medications as tolerated. - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. If you experience any of the following, please contact your surgeon: - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever - shaking chills, fever of more than 101 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or your medications - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing) -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you Additional: - pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest or back - urinary: burning or blood in your urine or the inability to urinate MEDICATIONS: - Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently. - If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to take, please call your surgeon. WOUND CARE: -You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off. -Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery unless told otherwise by your surgical team. -Notify your surgeon if you notice abnormal (foul smelling, bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising.

Pt was extubated, taken to the PACU until stable, then transferred to the ward for observation. Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a thoracic epidural and intravenous acetaminophen and ketorolac, but was split to a bupivacaine containing epidural and hydromorphone PCA on POD1. On POD2, the epidural catheter was inadvertently dislodged and ultimately removed by the Acute Pain Service. Once tolerating a diet, the pain regiment was transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone. CV: The patient was hypotensive on POD0-1 requiring fluid and albumin boluses and a decrease in the epidural rate with complete resolution. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. Given a temp of 101.1 on POD3, a chest x-ray was obtained and revealing for left sided atelectasis. He remained afebrile throughout the remainder of his hospitalization and his WBC normalized (6.3) by the day of discharge. GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO. On POD1, the diet was advanced to clears, but made NPO again on POD2 due to increased abdominal distention. However, on POD2, the patient began passing flatus and the diet was gradually progressed to regular which was well tolerated. On POD1, he was noted to have an acute kidney injury which resolved with fluid resuscitation. The Foley catheter was removed on POD2. The JP drain output was serosanguinous and left in place at the time of discharge. HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs of bleeding, of which there were none. Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

You should continue to walk several times a day. - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as tolerated. - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common sense and go slowly at first. - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. - Continue to wear your abdominal binder. - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you otherwise. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: - You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during the surgery. YOUR BOWELS: - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. PAIN MANAGEMENT: - You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean off these medications as tolerated. - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. If you experience any of the following, please contact your surgeon: - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever - shaking chills, fever of more than 101 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or your medications - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing) -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you Additional: - pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest or back - urinary: burning or blood in your urine or the inability to urinate MEDICATIONS: - Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently. - If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to take, please call your surgeon. WOUND CARE: -You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off. -Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery unless told otherwise by your surgical team. -Notify your surgeon if you notice abnormal (foul smelling, bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising.

By the time of discharge your diarrhea and nausea had resolved and we did not think you were contagious any longer. You were also sent for worsening weakness. Our neurology team evaluated you multiple times during your stay. You had an MRI that was unchanged. It was thought that this did not represent worsening of your GBS, thus you did not get any more IVIG. You have follow up with neurology in a few weeks. Please take your medications as prescribed. It was a pleasure taking care of you! Your ___ careteam

Pt was started on subcutaneous Insulin coverage once gap had closed, with frequent finger sticks. Potassium was repleted PRN. Differential for precipitating factors included diarrhea, gastroparesis, c.diff, MI, infection, or viral gastroenteritis (given pt's lower abdominal discomfort on admission). Pt also may have had TSS with history that a tampon was left in place for 5 days (this history was revealed on a few days after admission). Pt received a single dose of Levoquin in ED on admission, which was not continued in the ICU given that she had borderline high normal WBC and afebrile. Tachycardia resolved with hydration. Upon discovery of retained tampon during hospital stay, vancomycin was started, however, this too was discontinued based on the absence of clinical symptoms and signs. 2) Unstable angina: Pt complained of substernal chest pain in the ED. EKG changes were initially felt to be consistent with demand ischemia due to tachycardia. Pt had cardiac enzyme elevation that peaked then slowly trended down. Pt continued to have short episodes of chest tightness, and cardiac enzymes were cycled. ASA, statin (80 mg daily rather than 10 mg daily, which is her home dose), metoprolol, isosorbide dinitrate (later switched to isosorbide mononitrate extended release) were continued. Heparin gtt were used intermittently with her symptoms. Pt underwent cardiac catherization on ___, which showed diffusely diseased vessels and two out of three occluded grafts (which were previously seen in ___. No interventions were made. 3) DM, type 1 ___ followed the patient during her stay. Pt's insulin regimen were optimized according to blood sugar checks. Pt was encouraged to take part in sliding scale insulin administration. Pt was discharged home on Glyburide 5 mg daily, Lantus 18 units at dinner time, and short-acting insulin with carbohydrate counting. Pt has an appointment to follow up at ___. 4) ARF: Cr 1.7 on admission. Improved to 0.7 with aggressive hydration. U/S of transplanted kidney showed mild pelviectasis. Because pt received dye for cardiac cath, pt was instructed to get a check of BUN and Cr when she follows up with her PMD. 5) Lower abdominal tenderness: unclear etiology. UCG was neg. Resolved shortly after admission. 6) S/p renal transplant: Pt's regular immunosuppressive therapy was continued. Renal team followed pt as inpatient. Pt was advised not to miss any transplantation medications (may open capsules and take the powder sublingually if unable to tolerate PO due to nausea). Pt's Prograf levels were in the lower limits of therapeutic range when checked during hospitalization. Pt was instructed to get a repeat level at her PMD's office when she goes for her follow-up appointment. 7) Right heel ulcer She regularly sees a podiatrist as outpatient for foot care. Podiatry was consulted as inpatient, who recommended that adaptic and guaze dressing be continued, as the ulcer is healing well. 8) Depression: stable - continued cymbalta 9) Code: DNR, but do wish to be intubated if necessary.

Secondary -coronary artery disease -Hypertension -paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -Normocytic anemia <DISCHARGE CONDITION> Stable vital signs. Patient able to ambulate with assistance. Alert and oriented x 3. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You came to the hospital because you were feeling short of breath and in respiratory distress. You were found to have a recurrence of your pleural effusions, fluid in your lungs. Multiple tests were done including analysis of the fluid which did not show any obvious cancer or signs of infection causing the effusion. The cause of the effusions remains unclear. You had chest tubes inserted to help removed the fluid. In addition to the chest tubes, you were also given a diuretic called furosemide (lasix) to help remove the fluid. . You were thought to have pneumonia. You finished your course of treatment while in the hospital. . You should come back to the hospital or call your primary doctor if you develop a worsening cough, fever >100.3, chills, or difficulty breathing. . Your medications have changed in the following way: ","Summary: ___ yo female with coronary artery disease status post PCI, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, breast cancer status post radical mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade status post pericardiocentesis left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. . #Bilateral pleural effusion (left>right): The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a recurrence of her left sided pleural effusion leading to complete left lung collapse and hypoxemia, requiring intubation. Thoracic surgery inserted a chest tube on the left and a pigtail catheter on the right which both drained serosanginous fluid. The chest tube on the right was eventually pulled after it stopped draining. The insertion of the chest tube on the left was complicated by a pneumothorax, so another chest tube was inserted on the left with a pigtail catheter. The pigtail catheter eventually stopped draining and it was subsequently pulled. A talc pleurodiesis was performed and the patient's pain was controlled with Dilaudid at first and then oxycodone thereafter. Her chest tubes were removed and a chest xray confirmed full expansion of the left lung with an unchanged pleural effusion. She continued to be diuresed with Lasix, however, she developed a metabolic alkalosis with a respiratory acidosis. Diamox was added to the lasix regimen and her bicarbonate remained level. Her final chest xray shows left lower lobe atelectasis. Movement and incentive spirometry were encouraged and should be continued at rehab. The patient continues to have an oxygen requirement, likely due to her atelectasis and possibly an underlying pulmonary process. She has a scheduled pulmonology followup appointment that was made at her last hospitalization. At that time, they will perform pulmonary function testing. . While in the ICU, the patient was started on prednisone for a post-viral serositis. The prednisone was eventually discontinued after 5 days because the post-viral serositis was unlikely in this context. Analysis of the pleural fluid showed the absence of malignant cells in cytology, no bacteria/viral/acid fast bacteria on repeat cultures, and flow cytometry showed no cells concerning for lymphoma. The pleural effusions might be due to exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure, though on prior admissions, the effusion did not appear to be a transudate. Lastly, A CT of the abdomen from ___ showed a cyst in the lower abdomen. A CA125 was mildly elevated and a ___ was in the normal range. A pelvic U/S was done to further characterize the cyst and it was noted to be a simple cyst and not concerning for malignancy. . #Septic shock: The patient was initially hypotensive and the differential included septic shock vs. cardiogenic shock. A bedside echo in the ED did not find evidence of tamponade, so the patient most likely had septic shock with the source of infection being pulmonary. Her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids boluses. She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin/zosyn to cover hospital acquired pneumonia and the patient improved. She completed a full course of vancomycin/zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia and did not have any other signs of hemodynamic instability. . #Acute on chronic anemia: The patient continued to have a low hematocrit with iron=10 (L) and a slightly high ferritin. Her stools were guiaic negative. The patient might have an underlying iron deficiency anemia, though it is unclear given her high ferritin. A reticulocyte count showed an appropriate reponse to her anemia. After repeated blood draws, the patient's hematocrit steadily dropped to 21.8. On ___, she was transfused two units of blood and tolerated it well. On discharge, her hematocrit was 28.9. . #Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which was likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10. With treatment of her hypotension, the patient's renal failure trended towards her baseline around 0.6-1.0. With continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for BP management, the patient developed acute renal failure again. Her diuresis was held and lisinopril discontinued. Her creatinine on discharge was 1.4. . #Urinary tract infection: The patient presented with a urinary tract infection and was treated with vanco/zosyn as detailed above. She then developed yeast in her urine and her foley was removed. Two days after her Foley was removed, she had a leukocytosis without fever or dysruia. A urine culture revealed pan-senstive Pseudomonas 10,000-100,000 colonies. Treatment with Cipro was initiated and her leukocytosis trended downwards. No yeast remains in her urine. . # Anxiety and Depression- Continue trazodone and ativan as needed. The patient was noted to be anxious during the hospitalization and would consider further therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as an outpatient. . #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On admission, the patient was on amiodarone, metoprolol and coumadin. Since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia (not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry) throughout hospitalization, it was felt the risks of Coumadin outweighed the benefits, therefore, she will not continue on Coumadin. She will continue to take aspirin, metoprolol and amiodarone for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. . # Recurrent pericardial effusion: The pericardial effusion has also been a recurrent issue. A TTE showed an effusion without hemodynamic compromise, therefore, it was treated medically. A repeat echocardiograms showed a reduced effusion. . #H/O hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia that has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone release. Her sodium remained in normal range during her time on the floors, so she will not be continued on salt tablets on discharge. In fact, she should avoid sodium since it might precipitate congestive heart failure, the possible etiology of her pleural effusions. She will have a blood draw later in the week to check her sodium. On discharge, her sodium was 133. . # Swollen right arm: The patient was noted to have a swollen right arm. She had a PICC line during the last hospitalization. An ultrasound ruled out a deep venous thrombosis. With diuresis, the swelling improved, so it was likely related to fluid overload. . # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl . # Osteoporosis: Continue Vitamin D/Calcium . # GERD: Continue omeprazole . # Memory loss: The patient's family states that she does not have any memory loss. She came into the hospital on Donezepil and at the family's request, it was discontinued before discharge. Outpatient followup: 1. Cardiopulmonary assessment 2. Anemia workup/treatment, if any. 3.

He was initially brought to ___, and was transferred here upon finding of left hemispheric SDH and left temporal IPH. History is obtained from his son who is in the room. The patient lives in an assisted living facility, and has regular home health aides with him about 16 hours a day (they are gone from about 10pm to 8am). He had reportedly been in his usual state of health on ___, and his son talked to him on the phone (although, there is some concern for confusion as he called his daughter many times for his son's phone numbers, which he had and usually knows this). His other son was at the patient's house for dinner last night and did not note anything unusual. Then, this morning, when his regular home health aide came to see him, she felt that he was somewhat confused. Not many details are available, however it seems he was innattentive, and had to be fed, which is unusual. The aide put him in his recliner, and he seemed ""out of it."" She talked to his family, and the plan was to check his urine for a UTI. Around 3pm, a new aide came, and she could not rouse him. Therefore he was brought to ___. There, he was noted to have a left facial droop and drift. Heart rate 90-130s, BP unknwon. ___ showed an acute left SDH and left temporal IPH. Labs, including BMP, CBC, LFTs, and coags were wnl. Troponin was 0.05. He was transferred to ___ ___ where neurology was called. He has had no falls or head injuries that anyone knows of. He has a urinal with him in bed, so son does not think that he gets out of bed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The son thinks it is unlikely he had an unwitnessed fall because if he did, he would not be able to get himself up off the floor. When asked if he hit his head, he says ""no."" At baseline, he has hypophonia and trouble getting his words out (freezing when talking) and has speech therapy. Otherwise he is described as ""very sharp and alert"" (would know the date, the president, etc). He can still prepare meals. (esually microwaves). He mainly uses a wheelchair to get around.

He was initially brought to ___ and was transferred to ___ after ___ showed left hemispheric SDH and left temporal IPH as well as very small R sided SDH. Although there is no history of any trauma, the location and different types of bleed are most consistent with a traumatic mechanism. Also, patient does have frequent falls at home. It is also possible that he struck his head on something and does not remember this. #NEUROLOGY - L SDH, L temporal IPH, small R SDH. NCHCT was stable day after admission. MRI/A head showed no evidence of infarct, mass, vascular malformation, or VST. He was started on Keppra for a 7 day course of seizure prophylaxis. That should be discontinued after ___. His aspirin has been held in the setting of the hemorrhage. Aspirin 81mg can be re-started on ___. History of PD: home sinemet and selegine were continued. It is imperative that the patient takes these medications regularly. #CV Patient has known afib. Heart rates were slightly elevated to the mid teens and home metoprolol was increased from 25mg bid to 37.5mg bid. He is not on anticoagulation as he is at high risk for fall.

He was initially brought to ___, and was transferred here upon finding of left hemispheric SDH and left temporal IPH. History is obtained from his son who is in the room. The patient lives in an assisted living facility, and has regular home health aides with him about 16 hours a day (they are gone from about 10pm to 8am). He had reportedly been in his usual state of health on ___, and his son talked to him on the phone (although, there is some concern for confusion as he called his daughter many times for his son's phone numbers, which he had and usually knows this). His other son was at the patient's house for dinner last night and did not note anything unusual. Then, this morning, when his regular home health aide came to see him, she felt that he was somewhat confused. Not many details are available, however it seems he was innattentive, and had to be fed, which is unusual. The aide put him in his recliner, and he seemed ""out of it."" She talked to his family, and the plan was to check his urine for a UTI. Around 3pm, a new aide came, and she could not rouse him. Therefore he was brought to ___. There, he was noted to have a left facial droop and drift. Heart rate 90-130s, BP unknwon. ___ showed an acute left SDH and left temporal IPH. Labs, including BMP, CBC, LFTs, and coags were wnl. Troponin was 0.05. He was transferred to ___ ___ where neurology was called. He has had no falls or head injuries that anyone knows of. He has a urinal with him in bed, so son does not think that he gets out of bed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The son thinks it is unlikely he had an unwitnessed fall because if he did, he would not be able to get himself up off the floor. When asked if he hit his head, he says ""no."" At baseline, he has hypophonia and trouble getting his words out (freezing when talking) and has speech therapy. Otherwise he is described as ""very sharp and alert"" (would know the date, the president, etc). He can still prepare meals. (esually microwaves). He mainly uses a wheelchair to get around.

She then slept for the rest of the night comfortably without CPAP until her CNA woke her up in the morning as per routine. Patient had plans for the day but decided to present to the ED for evaluation of her two abrupt awakenings overnight. Patient's CPAP does not have an apnea alarm. In further exploring her symptoms, patient reports she is (and has been in the recent few days) at her baseline ___ right sided chest pain and abdominal pain. She has an undulating course of shortness of breath also since ___, and although she has been on a mild upswing this week, she is not here for that complaint, as her breathing is still essentially within the worse limit of her baseline. However, she does believe she has been drinking more water lately (dry lips), and feels her ___ edema has worsened. Also reporting increased swelling/edema to lower pannus. She has had multiple admissions under circumstances (most recently in ___. She acknowledges that she sometimes has rib spasms and presents to the ED when she cannot regulate her breathing.

The precipitating cause for this was unclear, but the subacute decline despite uptitration of immunosuppressive medications was concerning and the patient was admitted to the Neurology ICU. # Myasthenia Crisis The patient's exam showed significant bulbar and proximal weakness over the course of many days and required intubation shortly after admission to the hospital. He underwent plasmapheresis x 5 sessions (___). Neuromuscular specialists were consulted for treatment recommendations, with the following changes: azathioprine 200 mg daily, prednisone 60 mg daily, stop mestinon. TPMT activity normal, CT chest negative for thymoma, per outpatient neurologist. . Patient was initially NPO because of significant bulbar weaknees, with NS @ 75cc/hr. Once the patient was intubated, an OG was placed and TF were started. After extubation, he was evaluated by speech and swallow and passed - able to tolerate a regular diet which he will continue after discharge. . Physical therapy also worked with the patient and felt that he had no deficits after several inpatient ___ deficits and was safe for home discharge. . # Pulmonary - Respiratory failure, mixed Patient was intubated on ___ due to respiratory muscle fatigue, increasing O2 requirement, and increasing hypercarbia. He had increased secretion despite discontinuing mestinon. There was concern for aspiration pneumonitis causing elevated WBC but CXR was negative for aspiration or atelectasis. The patient had yellow mucoid secretions and was monitored closely for pneumonia. BAL showed no growth. Antibiotics were given for several days and then were discontinued. . # ID The patient was febrile to 100.8 on ___. Respiratory and urine cx were sent and returned negative. Empiric Abx with vanc/cefepime were started but DCed once culures returned negative. . # Blood pressure Patient was on continuous telemetry monitoring, with no acute events. Lisinopril was initially continued on admission but then held because of soft pressures after intubation; he was on low dose phenylephrine while on propofol, but the pressor was weaned off after 3 days. He was resumed on his lisinopril on discharge. . # Endocrine Home metformin was held due to need for multiple medication changes and tests that could affect renal function. The patient was treated with insulin SS. Metformin was reinstated and tolerated well prior to discharge. . # TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # - Increased prednisone to 60mg daily - Increased azathioprine to 200mg daily - Stopped Mestinon ",3896,620,"Input: <SEX> F <SERVICE> ONCOLOGY <CHIEF COMPLAINT> worsening back pain <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presenting with worsening back pain over the last two weeks.

GI was consulted, and the case was staffed with her outpatient gastroenterologist. She had negative stool cultures. She underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy, the findings of which were consistent with active ulcerative colitis (pathology similarly consistent with UC). CT scan showed colonic inflammation to the splenic flexure, consistent with a UC flare. Colorectal was consulted, with plan for surgery. She underwent a laparoscopic proctocolectomy with end ileostomy on ___. She tolerated the procedure well with no complications and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. Please see the operative note for technical details. Postop, her pain was initially controlled with a dilaudid PCA then she was switched to oral pain meds. Her diet was initially advanced to clears on POD#1 but he became nauseous from this was was made NPO again. She was then advanced slowly till she was tolerating a regular diet. On POD#7, she c/o urinary urgency and a UA showed large luekocytes so she was given ceftriaxone for one day then switched to 3 day course of ciprofloxacin. The days afterwards were spent encouraging her to increase her PO intake, working with a dietician and continuing TPN. By POD#11, she was ambulating with assistance, tolerating regular diet and her pain was controlled with oral pain meds so she was deemd fit for discharge to a rehab facility. # Hypokalemia: Ongoing hypokalemia associated with continued diarrhea. She was repleted twice to three times daily while being monitored on telemetry. # Weakness: Nonfocal neurologic exam throughout with negative head CT and no signs or symptoms of sepsis. Most likely due to deconditioning and ongoing diarrheal losses. Patient refused to work with Physical Therapy while on the ___ but was willing to ambulate and get OOB after surgery. Her nutrition was supplemented with Ensure and she was started on TPN postop. She was also given Megace to help stimulate her appetite; calorie counts were ordered and she was seen by a dietician to advice her on the best types of foods to consume to maximize caloric intake. # Acute on Chronic Anemia: Likely having small GI losses from her ulcerative colitis with low iron stores from poor nutrition. Because she is a Jehovah's Witness, she will not accept blood products; a signed acknowledgement of this was placed in her chart, and confirmed with her HCP/daughter. # Latent TB: Patient had been started on INH in preparation for starting Remicade; however, after biologic therapy was determined not to be an option for her, patient opted to discontinue her INH. # Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS-VASC of ___ with history of stroke putting her at high thromboembolic risk. Xarelto was stopped pre-operatively in favor of heparin gtt... Her home metoprolol was continued (except when held for low blood pressures responsive to IV fluids as above). Postop, heparin gtt was stopped and levenox was restarted. She was restarted on metoprolol to control her atrial fibrillation after surgery. She will restart Xarelto after discharge. # Glaucoma: Continued home dose eye drops. # Hypertension: Held home Norvasc given normotension (with occasional episodes of hypotension).

You will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these results they will contact you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home to finish your recovery. Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that you will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation. You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen which are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called Dermabond. These are healing well however it is important that you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or swelling of the area. Please call the office if you develop any of these symptoms or a fever. You may go to the emergency room if your symptoms are severe. You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with steri-strips (little white adhesive strips) instead of Dermabond, these will fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or swimming for 6 weeks after surgery unless told otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___. You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication oxycodone. Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily.

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: - High Cholesterol - Amyloid angiopathy - Coronary artery disease, Peripheral vascular disease We are changing your medications as follows: - START atorvastatin 80mg DAILY - HOLD pantoprazole for now. It clogs your PEG tube. You are receiving the IV version. - CONTINUE amlodipine 5mg DAILY. - CONTINUE aspirin 81mg DAILY. - CONTINUE clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg DAILY. Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician as listed below. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body Thank You, Your ___ Neurology Team ","___ year-old left-handed man with CAD, HLD, PAD/PVD, cerebral amyloid, and multiple prior strokes who presented from OSH with worsened lower extremity weakness and dysphagia. Imaging was significant for new left lateral medullary infarct. Likely etiology is significant atherosclerosis. Primary problem remains dysphagia, which has worsened from baseline. Cranial nerve exam revealed rightward tongue deviation, and poor right palate elevation, guttural voice with significant dysarthria (but comprehensible). Full strength in all muscle groups, but LUE ataxia and difficulties with mobility (per ___. # Dysphagia: Dysphagia is a chronic problem for him, which he managed with a specific diet and extreme caution. His dysphagia worsened following this new stroke, though he was able to manage his secretions by various methods of coughing and utilizing the Yankauer suction tip, which was in his hand essentially all day every day during his admission. He failed video swallow with significant deficits and a PEG was placed on ___. The tube was revised to a larger bore on ___ due to becoming clogged with crushed PO pantoprazole. We switched his PO pantoprazole to IV since the crushed PO formulation was clogging his PEG tube. This may be changed to a more compatible solid PPI. ___ and his wife are highly motivated for rehab with physical and speech therapy. # Impaired mobility: Despite full strength on physical exam, he has had worsened mobility due to a combination of deconditioning and ataxia. He will benefit from continued physical therapy and I believe his prognosis is good for becoming ambulatory. # Overnight desaturations: While asleep his SaO2 would regularly drop to the mid-80s. While it seems most likely due to management of his secretions, he never showed any signs of aspiration (including clear chest imaging), so there may be an element of sleep apnea. However, we would not recommend CPAP due to increased risk of aspirating those secretions under positive pressure. He used supplemental O2 during some of his admission, but disliked wearing the nasal cannula, and did not need it during the day. It seems likely his overnight saturations are normal for him and something he has tolerated for years. # Atherosclerosis: We continued the atorvastatin 80mg which was started at the OSH. # Hypertension: Due to his stroke, we allowed his BP had been allowed to auto-regulate. We restarted his home amlodipine 5mg on the day of discharge. # CAD s/p DES: We held his Plavix for 3 days prior to the PEG tube placement, even though the usual hold is 5 days. His cardiologist noted his critical stents and was comfortable with at maximum a 3 day pause. His Plavix and aspirin should be continued indefinitely. # Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: His MRI revealed numerous old microhemorrhages highly suggestive of amyloid. The highest level of anticoagulation/antiplatelet that we are comfortable with is aspirin and Plavix -- which is especially needed for his cardiac stents. He shouldn't be anticoagulated with Coumadin, apixaban, or any other of the newer agents due to his very high risk of cerebral hemorrhage. ============================================ AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 1.

You had a benign abdominal exam without fevers, chills or recent sick contacts making bowel obstruction or infection unlikely. The symptoms started after transitioning to oral antibiotics while in the hospital last week and this was felt to be the most likely cause of your symptoms. After speaking with your surgeon, Dr. ___, the decision was made to stop your flagyl (a common cause of stomach upset) and fluconazole. Your symptoms improved significantly with antiemetics (medications for nausea) and transition to ciprofloxacin only. At discharge, you were tolerating a normal, diabetic diet and able to take in adequate calories. Because of this, you were not felt to need nutritional support with tube feeds or TPN at this time. It is very important that you continue to consume enough calories to maintain your weight and ultimately start to gain back the weight you have lost over the last several months. While you were here, you noted that your pain post-surgery was significantly improved and your oxycontin was decreased from 40mg BID to 30mg BID. We also have provided you with stool softeners to prevent constipation. Please continue to take ciprofloxacin twice daily until you follow-up with Dr. ___ at ___ for drain removal on ___. It was a pleasure taking care of you! Your ___ Care Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman who is 4 weeks s/p total pancreatectomy (complete pancreatectomy, total splenectomy, partial duodenectomy, partial gastrectomy, islet cell re-implantation) complicated by bacteremia (enterobacter) and two abdominal abscesses 1.5 weeks ago who presented with several days of nausea/vomiting on oral antibiotics. # Nausea/vomiting: The patient was evaluated for common etiologies of nausea/vomiting. Obstruction was not likely given his relatively benign exam and history recent bowel movements. Recurrence of his intrabdominal infection was less unlikely given no recent fevers or changes in output from his drains and improved WBC count. Gastroenteritis also unlikely, given no recent sick contacts and improvement with IV abx. His symptoms are most likely related to recent changes to PO medication list, notably a switch from IV to PO ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and fluconazole. A review of OSH records and discussion with the attending surgeon (Dr. ___ at ___ clarified antibiotic requirement. The patient had documented ciprofloxacin-sensitive E. aerogenes (GNR) bacteremia secondary to a PICC line, however patient has been on fluconazole and flagyl for 2 weeks without a clear target. The outpatient surgery team and inpatient medicine team agreed the fluconazole and flagyl could be discontinued given lack of culture data or clinical suspicion supporting their use beyond two weeks. The patient was switched to PO ciprofloxacin only, and allowed to progress his diet as tolerated. The patient did not feel nausea with the PO ciprofloxacin and progressed from a clear liquid, full liquid, to a regular diet by the time of discharge. He also gained weight during his recovery. PICC line placement was discussed with the patient, but given his tolerating PO ciprofloxacin, his progressing diet, and his gaining weight, this was not pursued, especially given his recent PICC-line associated bacteremia and splenectomy making TPN high risk. The patient was given a bowel regimen and was stooling comfortably before discharge. # Failure to thrive: The patient reports poor PO intake since before his pancreatectomy. Given improving PO intake and recent bacteremia, it was decided not to start TPN during this admission. The patient was seen by nutrition and caloric intake and his daily weights were monitored. By the time of discharge, his weight was stable on regular diabetic diet. # Total pancreatectomy: The patient's two JP drains were left in place. The patient was continued on his prescribed insulin replacement therapy. The patient was given his oxycontin dose for pain. The patient's pain was well-controlled and by the end of his hospitalization, his oxycontin dose was decreased to 30mg BID. The patient was also continued on his PPI. # Thrombocytosis: The patient was admitted with platelets over 1000. This is most likely reactive in the setting of recent surgery and due to splenectomy. His PLT count was downtrending through his stay and he was continued on his ASA 325mg. # Anxiety: The patient was treated with his home dosing of Escitalopram.

You were diagnosed with a new stroke, which likely caused aspiration (the cause of the fever). After many conversations, it was decided to start you on a blood thinner, which you will need to continue. During this hospitalization, when you were sleepy, you were not able to tolerate oral medications; however, this has improved dramatically. Please keep all of your follow up appointments and take all of your medications as prescribed. ","Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with cardiac history, atrial fibrillation not on warfarin, and recent stroke who was admitted with fever and altered mental status, with MRI demonstrating new stroke. #) New CVA. Discovered on MRI from ___, thought likely secondary to embolism from atrial fibrillation. Seen by neurology who recommended anticoagulation with warfarin. The conversation was complicated by a history of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the context of community acquired pneumonia, the details of which are unclear. However, after talking to the primary care physician and family, the risks of anticoagulation were weighed against the risk of further embolic stroke, and the decision to anticoagulate was made. A heparin drip was initiated and is stable at 800 units/hr at goal PTT 50-70. He was started on warfarin on HD #5, and the dose should be adjusted according to his INR. The heparin drip should be stopped once his INR > 2.0 for more than 24 hours. #) Altered mental status. LP negative in ED, flu swab negative. Multifactorial: sedating medications (trazodone/zolpidem at rehab), infection (aspiration pneumonia, see below), thalamic stroke. Resolved over the course of the hospital stay, and upon discharge is interactive and responsive, moving all extremities, and participatory in rehab. #) Aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis. CVA + sedatives likely predisposed to aspiration. Unclear if infected, but did have temperatures early in hospitalization, resolved by day #3. Continued treatment should be with cefepime and metronidazole per infectious disease, to complete a total 10 day course (last day ___. All CSF, urine and blood cultures remained negative throughout admission. #) Traumatic hematuria. Resolved with continuous bladder irrigation, and foley was removed on hospital day #4. #) Hyponatremia. Resolved with IV fluids and ___ intake. Sodium 140 at the time of discharge. #) Failed speech and swallow. Failed evaluation ___, but then started to wake up and become more interactive. He passed the evaluation and was started on nectar thickened liquids and pureed foods on ___. Further evaluation can be done as needed. #) Hypertension. When unable to take his ___ medications (___), he was very hypertensive. This improved with addition of ___ antihypertensives; his blood pressure should be monitored to ensure good control (SBP 120-140). #) Atrial fibrillation. When unable to take his ___ medications (___), he had periodically high heart rates (120-140) which responded to IV metoprolol. This resolved with the re-starting of his oral medications (digoxin, atenolol). #) Family Meeting. Code status and goals of care reviewed with patient's son and wife; he is DNR/DNI. Wife stated that patient had expressed wishes to not have any life prolonging therapies, but she is stating that she wishes that he be treated for this acute illness. Other chronic and stable problems include: - BPH, s/p TURP ___ - amiodarone-induced corneal deposits ___ - BLE varicosities/venous stasis; - osteopenia with multiple spinal compression Fx; - GERD ",4138,716,"Input: <SEX> F <SERVICE> ONCOLOGY <CHIEF COMPLAINT> worsening back pain <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presenting with worsening back pain over the last two weeks.

","___ M h/o chronic systolic CHF (EF 40-45%), COPD, basal carcinoma nevus syndrome, recent hospitalization for malignant otitis externa presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation in the ED. Treated with aggressive diuresis and improved. Extubated successfully and being discharged back to ___ for continued management of multiple medical problems. #Respiratory failure: VBG on arrival to ED was 7.___/31. Per report, patient was awake and expressed desire for intubation in the ED; he was intubated in the ED without complication. Given marked peripheral edema on exam, the patient's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to acute CHF exacerbation and volume overload. There was also question of superimposed pneumonia, but patient did not have leukocytosis or fever (patient also on broad antibiotics - vancomycin and meropenem - prior to presentation for ear infection), so thought to be less important clinically. Patient was started on a lasix drip 20 mg/hr, and responded well to it with good urine output. With improvement in respiratory status, patient was extubated successfully. #Chronic systolic CHF/CAD: Thought to be secondary to past ischmic event based on segmental hypokinesis seen on TTE several weeks prior to admission. Metoprolol was held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation. PO metoprolol was restarted at home dosing. Patient is being discharged on IV lasix 80 mg BID. ___ was not started given the report of increased creatinine in the past with ___, though it would be an appropriate medication for his CHF management. If his creatinine continues to improve with further diuresis, addition of ___ or spironolactone may be considered. #Hypoglycemia: Blood glucose was in ___ on admission; no diabetes medications on admission. Patient was maintained on D10 until he was extubated and was no longer NPO. Hypoglycemia resolved when patient was taking PO. #Goals of care: Patient was DNR/DNI on last admission but expressed desire for intubation in ED. Patient initially expressed a desire to be full code, but with continued discussion, stated that he would like to be DNR, but ok to intubate. Continued discussion with both the patient and his family would be useful. #Malignant otitis externa: Patient was hospitalized 2 weeks ago for otitis externa; he was still on IV vancomycin, IV meropenem, and tobramycin/dexamethasone ear drops on admission. Although the original 2-week abx courses ended on ___, IV meropenem and tobramycin were continued. Vancomycin was held for several days given high vancomycin troughs. Prior to discharge, his vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued and his outpatient ID team was notified of the decision. He will follow up with his ID team and ENT as an outpatient for further management. #Stage IV CKD: Cr was stable at 2.3-2.5 (prior baseline according to last discharge summary was 2.7 in ___. Home regimen of nephrocaps, sevelamer, and vitamin D were restarted after extubation. #COPD: Patient's home regimen of fluticasone-salmeterol and tiotropoium was continued. PRN ipratropium was discontinued given that the patient was also on tiotropium. Given the exam without a lot of wheeze, it was thought that his COPD was not the main contributor to his respiratory distress. #GERD: PO omeprazole held while on IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis; restarted after extubation. #BPH: PO tamsulosin restarted after extubation. #Glaucoma: home latanoprost, dorzolamide, and artificial tears were continued. #DM: reportedly diet-controlled and patient had period of hypoglycemia while he was NPO and intubated. Blood sugars ok while taking PO. #Anemia: PO iron and ascorbic acid were restarted after extubation. #Hyperlipidemia: PO atorvastatin was restarted after extubation. #HTN: Metoprolol was held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation, but restarted after he was extubated and his symptoms improved. #Depression: PO citalopram and trazodone were restarted after extubation. TRANSITIONS IN CARE: 1. CODE STATUS: DNR, ok to re-intubate 2. CONTACTS: Patient's son (___) ___ 3. MEDICATION CHANGES: 1. CHANGE lasix to 80mg IV twice daily 2. STOP Heparin IV infusion 3.

I talked to her daughter today as ___ was then on route to the hospital via ambulance. She has initial history of very significant ___, had a THR ___ years ago and the acetabulum failed to ingrown went vertical. We modified her with a revision acetabulum. Two months ago, utilizing ___ Longevity and trilogy series trabecular metal 56 mm shell with standard liner. Unfortunately, she has had posterior dislocation three times and has been wearing an abductor brace repeatedly comes out in flexion and internal rotation despite the brace. She is very compliant and very thoughtful person and I have no doubt that she has been doing her best to stay within the compliance regulation. In any event, the soft tissues which were limited at the time of the surgery in terms of available residual capsule and piriformis now will be completely torn out, certainly. We in the emergency room were able to easily relocate her with propofol and she was put into a knee brace and the postoperative x-ray shows complete reduction. She does have some evidence of osteolysis posterior to the cup which we have seen on all of her films, I think it relates to the fact that she has a bit of bilobed shape in this 56 mm native acetabulum and we had to bone graft and behind it. Screw fixation appears intact. The femoral side has never been an issue. My concerns in addition to the recurrent dislocation are whether or not she might have an infection. LABORATORY DATA: Her lab work today, white blood count is good at 9.3. She does have shifted 85% neutrophils, but no bands. However, her ESR is a little bit elevated at 27, but she is only two months postop, this is actually the lowest ESR we have seen on her in the three times that has been measured in ___ years. Her CRP is 13.6 and certainly while elevated, it is significantly improved from the 42.0 it was this ___. She has been aspirated this ___ and was culture negative with a low intra-articular WBC count of only 225 back in ___ when we made preparations for revision THR. She has never had symptoms suggestive of infection. Her incision looks fine. However, we are admitting her tonight planning to operate on her in two days with the revision acetabulum. In the morning, we will get a fluoroscopic-guided aspiration of the hip not only for cultures, but also for cell count, differential will be important. We tentatively have her on this or scheduled for two or three days from now, but we will be most interested in seeing whether or not the culture or fluid results show marked abnormality. If so, then the possibility of resection arthroplasty stands. Whether or not we would have to hold off on surgery for a couple days to await final culture results is a possibility. For now, we will make plans towards getting the equipment in for revision THR and if we need to change our course accordingly, we will. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> HTN, asthma, h/o breast cancer, raynauds <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Sister also with ___ <PHYSICAL EXAM> Well appearing in no acute distress Afebrile with stable vital signs Pain well-controlled Respiratory: CTAB Cardiovascular: RRR Gastrointestinal: NT/ND Genitourinary: Voiding independently Neurologic: Intact with no focal deficits Psychiatric: Pleasant, A&O x3 Musculoskeletal Lower Extremity: * Incision healing well with staples * Scant serosanguinous drainage * Thigh full but soft * No calf tenderness * ___ strength ___ * SILT DP/SP/T/S/S * Toes warm <PERTINENT RESULTS> ___ 09: 23PM ___ PTT-31.3 ___ ___ 08: 37PM URINE COLOR-Straw APPEAR-Clear SP ___ ___ 08: 37PM URINE BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-NEG ___ 07: 58PM GLUCOSE-99 UREA N-17 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-12 ___ 07: 58PM estGFR-Using this ___ 07: 58PM CRP-13.6* ___ 07: 58PM WBC-9.3 RBC-4.43 HGB-12.3 HCT-36.7 MCV-83 MCH-27.8 MCHC-33.5 RDW-13.8 ___ 07: 58PM NEUTS-85.6* LYMPHS-11.1* MONOS-2.4 EOS-0.5 BASOS-0.4 ___ 07: 58PM PLT COUNT-453* ___ 07: 58PM SED RATE-27* <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> atenolol 50 mg QD, naprosyn prn, oxycodone prn, theophylline 200 mg BID, Cal/VitD, MVI <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).

Please call your regular doctor or come to the ED if you experience agitation, change in your mental status, confusion, fever, chills, or any other symptoms that concern you. ","In brief this is a ___ year old male with dementia and CKD admitted for aggressive behavior. . #. Agressive behavior. Medical workup for delerium has been negative. Patient has been afebrile with an normal WBC and negative UA. Head CT showed no acute changes. Utox and Stox were negative. Renal function was at baseline. Most likely the agitation is secondary to patient's Alzheimer's dementia and worsening over two weeks prior to admission may be due to enviroment/medication changes. Psych was consulted and they recommended d/c all psychotropic drugs except olanzepine. The patient did very well with olanzapine (2.5 mg in am, 2.5 mg at 3 pm and 7.5 mg HS; also prn SL olanzepine q 4 hrs prn). For insomnia pt did well with an additional 2.5mh prn qhs dose in addition to his standing 7.5mg qhs dose. . Over the course of the 2 weeks prior to discharge, pt has made dramatic behavioral improvements. He has taken all of his standing olanzapine and has required very few prn doses (more for increased confusion than agitation) since ___. He continues to wander in the hallway, but does not wander into rooms other than his own. He continues to require a 1:1 sitter, but this is only because he is very disoriented and may otherwise wander off the floor since this unit is not locked. He has not displayed aggressive behavior towards staff these past 2 weeks. . It is important to note, that his behavioral decompensation prior leading to this admission was most likely the consequence of too frequent medication changes. We strongly advise adherence to the previously described olanzapine regimen as much as possible. His family is comfortable with the sedation caused by this regimen and understands that it is the trade-off necessary for better behavioral control. . #. Chronic constipation. Bowel regimen included ___ standing and bisacodyl prn. Fleet enemas may be used as needed. Pt perseverates on his bowel movements. He always complains of constipation, even after having adequate bowel movements. . #. CKD. Renal function was at baseline and remained throughout hospitalization. Slight intermittent elevations in creatinine responded well to encouraging increased po intake.

Prolonged treatment with hydroxyurea can significantly worsen his wounds and therefore it has been used sparingly. He was initially thought to have rec'd a incorrect dose of anegralide at the nursing facility but after further review it seems he was getting the correct dose. His confusion improved with discontinuation of oxycodone. Tylenol was used for pain for left TMJ arthritis. He should follow up with ENT should this continue despite tylenol standing for the next week. He is CKD III so ibuprofen was not attempted. Tramadol was attempted but he seemed to still be confused with this medication. Mental status was at baseline on discharge. He claimed trauma to the jaw from an assault at his NH but this could not be verified because of his frontal dementia and confusion.

Your ___ Team ","================ PATIENT SUMMARY: ================ ___ h/o ESRD s/p living unrelated right renal transplant ___ c/b IFTA ___ bx), HTN, DMII who presented with hypoglycemia to OSH iso accidental lantus overdose and found to have ___ on CKD with course c/b flash pulmonary edema. His hypoglycemia resolved with initial extra glucose and he returned to home dose medications. He was diuresed with IV Lasix and PO torsemide with resolution of pulmonary edema on CXR and no supplemental O2 requirement. ___ on CKD with minimal decrease in GFR from 15 to 10 likely in the setting of worsening renal function with plan for close nephrology and transplant surgery follow up. He had vein mapping done in preparation for possible dialysis. # Hypoglycemia # DM II- Presented with confusion and ___ 40 in the setting of taking extra dose of lantus in one day instead of Humalog as he ran out of Humalog. Hypoglycemia resolved with glucose and fingerstick glucose levels normalized. Discussed extensively with patient regarding the difference between Humalog and lantus. Patient has full understanding but had run out of medication and forgotten that he had already taken lantus earlier that day. He was continued on home regimen of lantus and SS with normal glucose levels. He was found hypoglycemic to 40 on discharge in AM as he missed normal snack at night the previous night. Decreased Lantus to 30U from 35u with follow up appointment with PCP for further management. #Acute hypoxemia #Acute pulmonary edema- Received 2L of fluids in ED and IV Lasix 20mg with minimal urine output. Had an acute episode of hypoxia to 88% requiring 4L NC iso of hypertension to SBP 195 consistent with likely flash pulmonary edema. Diuresed with IV Lasix (total 280mg) with significant improvement in symptoms and resolution of pulmonary edema on CXR and return to room air without shortness of breath. CXR ___ w/ with possible pneumonia; however, patient had no clinical or lab evidence of pneumonia and was not treated. COntinued on labetalol and nifedipine for blood pressure and added Torsemide 40mg for volume and blood pressure management. # ESRD s/p living donor kidney transplant in ___ # Renal allograft dysfunction Renal biopsy on ___ with severe IFTA. At that time, Cr was 5.0 with a GFR of around 15 ml/minute. He presented with ___ with Cr up to 9 with GFR of 10 ml/minute. No uremic symptoms, hyperkalemia or other indications for dialysis at this point as pulmonary edema resolved with diuresis. Suspected that worsening Cr related to worsening kidney disease. Will require very close follow up with outpatient nephrology as well as transplant surgeon. Will see ___ transplant surgeon on ___ with scheduled labs and has second opinion at ___ scheduled as well. Will have appointment with Nephrologist on in the next week. Had vein mapping inpatient in preparation for possible dialysis but refused evaluation with transplant surgeon for fistula as he would like second opinion about transplant first. #HTN- Presented with hypertensive urgency with blood pressures better controlled after receiving home medications. Patient prescribed Nifedipine 60mg daily but believes that it makes him dizzy and prefers 30mg BID. He was continued on Labetalol and nifedipine (30mg BID). #Hypocalcemia- Decreased ionized calcium in the setting of elevated PTH and decreased vitamin D levels with CKD. Started supplementation with Vitamin D 50,000mg weekly, 4g of IV calcium gluconate and calcium carbonate QID between meals. #Metabolic acidosis- Stable metabolic acidosis in the setting of home sodium bicarbonate 650mg BID. Continued with home dose sodium bicarb with improvement HCO on discharge #Asymptomatic bacteruria- Found to have strep viridans (>100,000) on routine culture but asymptomatic. Given immunosuppression and renal transplant, treated with 14 days of Augmentin. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: #Anemia: hgb 8.9, baseline ___. Likely due to ESRD without evidence of bleeding.

He suffered signs/symptoms c/w anoxic brain injury and has resultant cognitive problems. Mr. ___ underwent a fairly lengthy psychiatric admission aimed at reducing his modifiable risk factors for suicide and enhancing his supports and educating his family about his illness and prognosis. During this long hospital course, Mr. ___ progressed in terms of mood and behaviors. After his initial outburst upon arrival to the unit, he had no behavioral problems and complied with treatment in the form of mood stabilizers (Depakote, Klonopin), and antipsychotics (Zyprexa). He also had 1 ECT treatment and underwent a number of neurological and cognitive tests. Mr. ___ in 2 lengthy family meetings and did well in them during which time the team educated patient and family about diagnosis, risk, and treatment plan along w/ discharge planning and outpatient recommendations to best mitigate risk. SAFETY: The pt. was placed on 15 minute checks on admission and remained here on that level of observation throughout. He was unit-restricted. ___: Patient became agitated when informed he could not receive oxycontin and PRN oxycodone at same time; physical altercation with nursing and security where patient swung at security and strangled a nurse.

LEGAL: ___ CONSULTS: Pain team Neurology Neuropsychology service ___ opinion by ___ medical director PSYCHIATRIC: #MDD, recurrent, severe w/ psychotic features Patient presented with MSE notable for dysphoric and restricted affect. He endorsed depressed mood although without suicidal ideation on unit, citing his history of impulsive violent behavior toward self and others but paradoxically stating grandchildren as the reason to live yet not being future-oriented toward wanting to live himself. Pt continued on home meds including Trazodone 100 mg PO/NG QHS for sleep with additional 50mg PO QHS PRN insomnia added.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Continue to take all your medicines and keep your appointments. We wish you the best! Sincerely, Your ___ Team ","SUMMARY STATEMENT ================= Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease s/p left AKA and R bypass c/b graft and popliteal artery stenosis s/p multiple angioplasties, DM, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, presenting with polymicrobial R heel infection s/p debridement x2, with wound vac and on IV vanc/cefepime/flagyl for 6 week course per ID recommendation. ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED: ===================== #Polymicrobial R heel osteomyelitis, R heel ulcer infection History of T2DM and severe PVD s/p R bypass with multiple angioplasties, chronic right heel ulcer, presented with heel ulcer drainage, pain and erythema. She underwent OR I&D/debridement x2 (___) with Podiatry. Operative debridement yielded deep purulence down to the calcaneus. Due to the chronicity of the ulcer and the proximity of the purulence so close to calcaneus, decision made to treat for osteomyelitis. Vascular surgery was consulted and said there was no need for intervention. Wound cultures grew two morphologies of e. coli (which had no clear PO options for treatment based on sensitivities, but were susceptible to CTX), b frag, and coag neg staph sensitive to clinda/vanc. No pseudomonas. Blood cx no growth. Infectious Disease team was consulted and recommended cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole given possibility of pseudonomonas ___ diabetic patient, even if not grown on culture. Antibiotic course planned for 6 weeks from last instrumentation ___, therefore finishing ___. She was cleared by Physical Therapy for home. She will follow-up with podiatry, vascular, and ID. Her daughter ___ was trained on taking care of the wound vac at home (per Podiatry, anticipate several weeks) and home antibiotic administration. She will have weekly labs checked. #Revision of diagnosis: No secondary adrenal insufficiency During last hospitalization, as part of workup for hyponatremia, she was thought to have secondary adrenal insufficiency. The etiology was not elucidated, however, she was started on hydrocortisone 10 mg QAM. Given active infection and surgery this admission, she received stress dose steroids with a taper. Following this, the ID team noted a positive quantiferon gold that had resulted from the last admission. Endocrine was reconsulted to further investigate the AI diagnosis as patient might require latent TB treatment if planning for chronic steroids. On repeat ___ stim testing, pt had appropriate and robust response, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely. MRI adrenal protocol was within normal limits. ACTH levels were normal. Patient no longer though to have AI. #Hyponatremia #?SIADH Worked up extensively last admission and felt to be due to secondary adrenal insufficiency with possible SIADH. This admission, adrenal insufficiency workup was again pursued and it was determined patient does not have this. Steroids were discontinued, pressures were maintained, and there was no ill effect. Several days later, patient's sodium downtrended. Urine studies consistent with SIADH so patient placed on fluid restriction of 1.5 liters. Her sodium levels fluctuated but ultimately stable and near normal limits. #Diabetes Mellitus, type 2 On admission, held home metformin 500mg PO BID, continued home lantus 10 units QHS, and provided insulin sliding scale. Elevated blood sugars ___ the setting of stress-dose steroids, were covered with NPH, subsequently discontinued. On ___, metformin 500mg BID was restarted as patient awaiting placement. #Hypertension Patient's blood pressures were elevated and lisinopril was uptitrated from 10mg to 40mg with good results. # Anemia Underlying Iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Hgb 9.1 on admission. Received 2U pRBC following surgeries. Patient was given IV ferrous gluconate for 4 days. Stable rest of admission. CHRONIC ISSUES ADDRESSED: ======================= #Type 4 RTA Diagnosed last admission and thought ___ diabetes. Continued on sodium bicarbonate. #Latent TB Quant gold+. No pulmonary sx, CXR unconcerning, and adrenals within normal limits on CT. Pt is at moderate risk for reactivation given insulin-dependent diabetes, though does not have adrenal insufficiency and so will not receive further steroids. ___ consultation with ID, treatment of latent TB was deferred. # Peripheral vascular disease History of severe peripheral vascular disease s/p left AKA and R bypass c/b graft and popliteal artery stenosis s/p multiple angioplasties. Chronic R non-healing ulcer ___ setting of T2DM and severe PVD. This admission she had noninvasive RLE arterial study which showed severe obstructive arterial disease. Vascular surgery was consulted and said that no intervention was indicated. Continued home ASA, atorvastatin, clopidogrel; stopped home cilostazol --for claudication, patient not ambulatory, and wanted to reduce pill burden and risk of side effects. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ================== [] f/u antihypertensive regimen [] f/u DM regimen [] please ensure family is comfortable with wound vac management. Training was done before discharge.
