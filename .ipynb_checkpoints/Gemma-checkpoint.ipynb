He reported associated shortness of breath and nausea. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads, and troponin levels were elevated, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. The patient was emergently taken to the catheterization lab, where coronary angiography revealed 100% occlusion of the right coronary artery. A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed, and dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated. He was monitored in the cardiac care unit for 48 hours with no complications.\n",

Imaging revealed a large intracranial mass in the right temporoparietal lobe with associated hemorrhage, necrosis, and vasogenic edema. He was started on Decadron to reduce cerebral edema and transferred for neurosurgical evaluation. On hospital day 5, the patient underwent an image-guided right craniotomy for tumor resection.

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and oxygen therapy. Arterial blood gas analysis showed mild hypoxemia, which improved with oxygen supplementation.

INDICATION: ___ mid patient, with endocranial mass lesion, to evaluate lesion. PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion, in the right temporoparietal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis and large solid enhancing component. The solid competent measures 5.0 x 4.3 cm. There is entrapment of the right temporal horn. There is surrounding significant vasogenic edema, with a leftward shift of subfalcine herniation; measuring approximately 1 cm is unchanged, allowing for technical differences, compared to the prior CT. Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, is unchanged. There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study. IMPRESSION: 1. Large heterogeneous mass lesion in the right parietal and temporal lobes, with cystic, necrotic, hemorrhagic and solid components, the solid competent measuring 5.0 cm, with significant surrounding edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation, and entrapment of the right temporal horn without significant change since the CT head done the day before. 2. 1.7-cm enhancing focus in the left parapharyngeal region, representing an abnormally enlarged lymph node, representing metastatic involvement. However, this is not completely included on our present study. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___ 2: 41 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: residual mass? Contrast: MAGNEVIST UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: ___ year old man with parietal mass s/p resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: residual mass? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None. GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass. Assess for residual tumor. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration. COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from ___. FINDINGS: There is a lace-like pattern of enhancement along the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe, apparently surrounding the right temporal horn body. There is persistent mild dilatation of the right temporal horn tip, but substantially reduced in extent compared to the prior preoperative study. Additionally, there is presumed hemorrhage along the operative tract, more peripherally situated within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. The extensive edema surrounding the formerly very large tumor appears unaltered in extent. However, overall, there is somewhat less mass effect, though there is still leftward subfalcine herniation present. Numerous tiny areas of elevated T2 signal are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, presumably representing chronic small vessel infarctions or post- inflammatory residua. There is soft tissue swelling, subgaleal in locale at the craniotomy site and there is a possible fluid collection or surgical material within the crescent- shaped space between the dura spanning the craniotomy flap and the inner table of the flap itself. There is redemonstration of the well- defined, rounded 21 mm area of contrast enhancement in the left parapharyngeal fat area. Its sharp margination seems most consistent with a benign neoplastic process (question neurogenic tumor). This location would be very unusual for a lymph node or metastatic disease, as was suggested on the previous report. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there is residual tumor in the region of the right temporal lobe surrounding the right temporal horn, with mild residual entrapment of this portion of the right lateral ventricle, as described above.

      "The patient's chief complaints include worsening back pain, chest pain, headache, and neurological issues. Radiological investigations showed various findings, including metastases, lymphadenopathy, and tumors. Treatment plans involved palliative radiation therapy, surgery for a parietal mass lesion, chemotherapy for renal cell carcinoma, and endoscopic procedures for brain tumors. The patient experienced significant side effects from medications, including acetaminophen overdose, and required close monitoring for infections and seizures. The patient was discharged with clearances to resume driving and work activities.\n"
